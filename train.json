only possible due to passionate hardcore fans  while others fail to understand the reasons behind the constant hype surrounding the filmmakers projects personally despite not belonging to his enormous fandom i quite enjoy his work outside of the dceu from dawn of the dead to watchmen passing through 300 i hold these films in high regard however batman v superman dawn of justice is unquestionably one of the biggest cinematic disappointments of my life and its arguably the movie that triggered the beginning of the controversial general opinion about the director usually when people find themselves on a rough path going back to their roots helps them get back on track which is precisely what snyder does here the zombie apocalypse genre has been around for decades but since the start of the new century audiences all over the world were able to witness a narrative that was once unique and exciting become one of the most overdone generic formulaic pieces of storytelling this last statement doesnt mean a few gems cant come out of it from probably the greatest zombie film ever train to busan to the comedy classic zombieland there are truly great movies within the genre so where does army of the dead stand somewhere in the middle labeled as good fun which is all i expected from this netflix film let me get one thing out of the way immediately this looks sounds and feels like a snyder movie countless overstylized shots long slowmotion scenes an overwhelming amount of gore and blood bizarre song choices a twohourandahalf runtime for better or worst no one can complain about studio interferences this time clearly the famous director had complete creative freedom and it shows through all of the films positives and negatives fortunately snyders filmmaking style not only fits well within this genre but it also works for the simple entertainmentdriven screenplay a vast majority of viewers will press play in the hopes of receiving an actionheavy fun uncomplicated zombie movie with all the attributes that these flesheating characters possess except for a genuinely interesting storyline  though not new  concerning a specific type of zombies everything else is pretty much what viewers have seen for the past two decades which might be disappointing yet still highly enjoyable from the way people can kill them to the time each infected person takes to become a zombie every single cliche is present in this film honestly none of them really annoy me unless theyre repeated to exhaustion which i dont believe army of the dead does that much the action sequences are all wellshot but i did expect more from them most scenes are just characters randomly shooting hitting insane headshots that viewers will just have to accept as something normal which shouldnt be too hard considering the recent action flicks occasionally oneonone or oneonmany combats ensue and it elevates the excitement levels by focusing on that single character but then its brought down again by tiresome shootouts snyder asks the viewers to accept several dumb plot and character decisions so its always going to be a matter of how much you can take until it starts getting too much personally these logical issues dont really bother me  the ridiculous third act does push my limits i admit however the lack of character development and overall care for everyone in the movie will always be a massive problem especially when supposedly emotional heartfelt moments end up having zero impact i doubt anyone will be surprised to find out that people die in this film besides the zombies consequently bringing tonal balance to the table obviously not every character needs to receive a deep backstory and complex motivations but it doesnt hurt to tell the viewers a bit about the people going into the danger zone so that the action sequences can carry more tension without spoiling anything theres a period in the movie where a deadly countdown begins and everything that occurs from the starting time to the climactic moment just feels like any other scene in the film the lack of tension and sense of urgency ultimately stops it from being one of the greats overall its an enjoyable zombie flick that offered me a blast of fun but i still believe it could have been a lot better dave bautista my spy avengers endgame is the absolute standout interpreting the only fullydeveloped character of the movie ella purnell wildlike  omari hardwick sorry to bother you  and nora arnezeder origin are also quite good finally a point must be made about the relationship between studios and filmmakers while im all in favor of creative freedom there must always be a compromise between both parties snyder didnt gain fame for badly editing his films for no reason army of the dead is like most of his movies unnecessarily long the deleted scenes feature on blurays doesnt exist for showoff theres no film in the history of cinema where every single second recorded is pure gold and runtimes are something studios can help filmmakers nail perfectly in the end i still consider this movie to move quickly through its straightforward story so the excess screentime might not be that big of an issue for other viewers army of the dead brings zack snyder back to the zombie apocalypse genre delivering an entertaining actiondriven story that will please most spectators with his distinct divisive filmmaking style completely unrestrained for better or worst the standout dave bautista and his team fight through the cliches lack of character development and excessive runtime to still offer plenty of excitement the lack of tension and urgency hurt some of the last action sequences but all are wellshot and packed with energy exceptional production design and vfx arent enough to compensate for the predictably formulaic screenplay especially when the only interesting zombie storyline is only partially explored overall its the definition of good fun so if your weekend has a twoandahalfhour empty slot netflix has my endorsement ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog  heres the thing about the fast furious franchise it can be dumb fun every movie has the right to be entertaining even if it completely disregards physics and logic as long as it establishes its tone from the start you cant make an action film where the main characters survive basically everything they shouldnt and take everything seriously its not that you cant have that mix of tones furious 7 did it brilliantly  but thats reserved for some of the best movies of the year since its not easy at all to balance so many different things hobbs shaw sets its tone in the first 10 minutes and everyone knows what theyre getting themselves into however it didnt quite work for me this time the fast furious saga is an undeniable success even more in my country where it constantly breaks boxoffice records it possesses everything a popcorn blockbuster should have tons of action car chases explosions fights shootouts  easytofollow plot and simple character development theres no problem in leaving your brain at the entrance of the theater for a couple of hours and just have fun of course hobbs shaw is ridiculous its completely absurd it has no sense of logic and its unbelievable how many physicsdefying sequences occur but thats exactly what they establish in those first few minutes so people just need to sit comfortably and eat that whole bag of popcorn while watching the most ludicrous action onscreen so if the tone is wellbalanced why didnt i enjoy it as much as the rest people seem to be having tremendous fun even critics who usually demolish this type of films are liking it  so i guess im in the minority here but i just found the action pretty underwhelming and the comedy was way off for me granted there are huge set pieces and there are a couple of great action scenes especially a motorbikecar chase between brixton hobbs and shaw true there are a couple of laughs that i couldnt contain due to how amazing statham and johnsons chemistry is nevertheless overall i just dont think its enough first of all my main issue with the story brixton idris elba is incredible as always and i really want him to be the next james bond however his character is so poorly written and so horribly explored that i wonder why they made him an enhanced machine with superpowers literally theres no difference between him and the other two main characters which ultimately destroys the superhero vibe elba should have thats the problem with having such an absurd movie if your heroes are undefeatable due to their enormous plot armor how is your superpowered villain different than them if an explosion goes off with the three of them close why do hobbs and shaw survive in the same way brixton does how does a punch from a black superman has the same impact as a punch from the other two then the comedy its not like i disliked statham and johnson bantering for five straight minutes in three different scenes its just too long and not all of the jokes land the film itself is way too long just over two hours if i didnt know about the whole samoa sequence from occasionally seeing it on a tv spot i would have believed the movie was about to end when it started its third act it feels like its going to end but then theres a whole other massive action set piece to show off for the first time in a long long time i almost fell asleep during the transition from the secondtolast to the last action moment the action is also very disappointing having in mind david leitch is directing too many quick cuts and way too choppy finally theres an attempt at the start of a romance that i wont spoil but its not like its forced because it actually isnt it follows a logical path characters dont say stupid stuff to each other and it was surprisingly being a good way of stopping to breathe and relax away from all the action however as the film reaches its conclusion they ditch it altogether and never address it anymore theres even a line similar to ill let you have a kiss tomorrow if were still alive but they never go there again its like it never happened why the only thing that was truly being logical and emotionally compelling is completely ignored by the end thats disappointing i dont want to be too harsh on the movie because i do understand how entertaining and fun it might be im sure audiences will love it and fans of the franchise will love it even more the chemistry of the cast is palpable and everyone is terrific dwayne johnson and jason statham are awesome as the action superstars and theyre definitely the main source of entertainment vanessa kirby is also pretty great and i have to commend the film for keeping two spectacular cameos under wraps you wont believe whos in this movie as well there are still a couple of cool action sequences and i did laugh more than a couple of times so i guess it isnt as bad as this review might transmit i know im in the minority so i recommend all of you to go watch it and judge it for yourselves if you enjoy absurdity ridiculousness and overthetop action as well as cheesy comedy hobbs shaw might be perfect for you it didnt really work for me though the comedy was not as good as i expected the action is not that captivating and brixton is such a horribly written and unexplored character that i kept feeling frustrated every time an action sequence ended go for the huge set pieces and the dumb fun stay for the amazing casts chemistry ps if you havent watched game of thrones by now heavy spoilers in this film youve been warned ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog 2020 is undoubtedly one of the worst years ever for movies not even in terms of quality but the infinite delays of highly anticipated films automatically make this year more underwhelming than what it would ever be nevertheless it still delivered a few surprises along the way movies that i wasnt really expecting to like as much as i did underwater the call of the wild  or even films that i knew id enjoy them but eventually end up absolutely loving them the one and only ivan palm springs the personal history of david copperfield  jacob chases feature directorial debut is amongst the former group i only knew the premise and the cast which i have to admit didnt really convince me but i still gave it a go since this could be my last trip to a film theater this year if it ends up truly being my last time watching a movie on the big screen this year then its a wonderful final film come play is one of the biggest surprises of 2020 there are so many aspects that i absolutely love about it but it doesnt escape from several issues as well ill start with the impressive performance of azhy robertson oliver as a nonverbal autistic kid as someone who has shared some time with a young autistic girl i left the theater fully believing that azhy was in fact autistic in reallife i didnt recognize him from marriage story  i was mindblown when i found out he wasnt his display feels so realistic and authentic that i never thought his portrayal was pure acting john gallagher jr marty is really good as well but he doesnt have as much screentime as gillian jacobs sarah  the latter isnt exactly awful but she definitely disappoints in the more sentimental moments shes great during the horror sequences adding to the suspenseful atmosphere but when the time comes to really deliver heartfelt dialogues and passionate expressions gillian fails to offer a convincing performance the other kids in the movie are also quite cringeworthy but not every young actor can be incredible at such a young age despite the casts irregular interpretations none ruins the captivating story behind larry the misunderstood monster on the other side of the screen the social commentary is loud and clear giving the film a whole other layer jacob chases commitment and dedication to this work based on his own short are palpable throughout the runtime visible through the numerous tiny details spread across each storyline i found myself astonishingly invested in the narrative however chase often repeats scenes meant to pass that social message he so desperately wants to transmit transforming many scenes that could be genuine into something extremely forced this last aspect is compensated with innovative horror sequences with highly creative use of todays technology to generate an incredibly tense environment there arent many jumpscares but most are pretty effective nevertheless its the suspenseful atmosphere throughout the entire movie that elevates the overall horror vibe chase also employs long takes which ultimately leaves viewers at the edge of their seats due to some excellent camera work maxime alexandre and seamless editing gregory plotkin  i really like the score roque ba os  but there are a couple of moments where the almost silent music weirdly becomes an adventure tune another brilliant technical decision comes from chases work with the vfx team as expected from a lowbudget production the visual effects would never reach todays standards if they decided to show the monster in plain sight during daylight if you go into the film expecting a monster movie where the latter is the protagonist forget it the crew was intelligent and humble enough to acknowledge the notthatgood vfx quality so chase hides the monster with low lighting and shows him during night sequences and or through a smartphone tablets camera it might be a disappointing aspect for many people but i was delighted with this smart decision its more of a family drama than a generic horror flick theres a fair attempt at delivering something special and i do believe it was very close to being one of the best films of the year the treatment of the autistic character is nearperfect i love the fact that not only the movie shows every problem that a condition like this brings but it also demonstrates the extraordinary qualities that autistic people possess even though he cannot speak oliver is exceptionally clever fun and brave something i believe most of todays society doesnt think autistic kids can be the ending is both bold and surprising finishing on a significant emotional moment that will leave viewers with a bittersweet reaction in the end come play is one of my favorite surprises of this year jacob chase proves that hes a dedicated filmmaker who knows his craft with exceptional preparation chase presents an extremely captivating narrative distinct from the generic horror flicks that flood every year by focusing on the emotionally compelling story instead of the formulaic jumpscares the horror sequences have a much more significant impact due to the viewers connection with the main characters especially azhy robertsons the latter delivers one of the best young performances of 2020 interpreting an autistic kid with remarkable authenticity however the rest of the cast is not up to the task especially gillian jacobs who disappoints with an overall emotionally underwhelming display the social commentary is important and efficiently transmitted despite chase eventually losing his balance and exaggerating the number of scenes that ultimately become forced technically the suspenseful atmosphere steals the spotlight from the few yet effective jumpscares ends with a surprisingly bold emotionally bittersweet moment as long as you dont expect a monster flick packed with predictable scares i sincerely recommend it to anyone looking for a halloween plan  ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog at the time of this review malcolm marie is already dividing critics worldwide which is far from being surprising having in mind its expectedly provocative premise being a film critic isnt exactly an easy task especially when it comes to deal with public opinion in most cases when one reaches a high level of success that always comes with a heavy dose of offensive tweets and personal attacks particularly when the authors opinion contradicts the audiences response so i was hoping that sam levinson would not contribute to the dozens of misconceptions surrounding film criticism and hundreds of conspiracy theories regarding journalists of the respective area unfortunately the extremely exaggerated borderline offensive overthetop monologues  kind word for rants  delivered by malcolm john david washington are simply more wood thrown to the already devastating fire what starts as a surprisingly rational thoughtprovoking comment on how some critics tend to make movies about something these arent attempting to be  mainly emphasizing a nonexistent political or racial message  quickly evolves to scenes featuring a childish immature selfabsorbed behavior from the male protagonist who blindly attacks hypothetical reviews from in his opinion horrible critics even though this is somewhat of a niche subject for the general audience its still a negative contribution to a challenging problem film critics face every day ive read the following comment more than a couple of times already sam levinson is using a black actor to transmit his white male directors frustrations on the industrys reviewers in my opinion whoever wrote something similar to this is falling into the exact same error malcolm aggressively accuses critics of doing reading too much into it and once again bringing race to a discussion where it doesnt belong it doesnt really matter if the screenplay is written by a frustrated levinson who decided to let out his thoughts about film criticism or by someone else entirely ultimately the characters are one of the main pillars of any movie and sadly theyre my main issue with the whole story despite the prologue above that i couldnt help not writing malcolm marie focuses on the toxic relationship of the two unlikable protagonists the adjectives used in the last sentence are hardly untrue malcolm and marie spend almost the entire runtime in a tiresome exhausting headacheinducing cycle of incredibly exaggerated fights followed by a temporary reconciliation by making out for a couple of minutes before the next big argument begins as soon as i finished the film marriage story came to my mind and i vividly remember tearing up when the main characters had that massive fight why did i feel so bothered and uncomfortable with malcolm and marie then because of their personalities malcolm is nothing more than a cocky egocentric selfindulgent filmmaker who believes hes the king of the world now that he delivered a good movie pride and arrogance are separated by a thin line but malcolm definitely incorporates the arrogant persona who cant even show signs of gratitude when positive reviews come in  instead delivers another rant on how the respective author didnt understand his film on the other hand marie zendaya starts as an apparently nice hardworking lovable young woman who just got stuck with the wrong man seemingly working as the equilibrium point in their relationship i do feel sorry for a lot of things that happened to her however marie quickly demonstrates that shes far from being a perfect girlfriend despite being much more tolerable and less unlikable than malcolm marie carries unforgivable mistakes from her past and shows an inability to accept that malcolm might have drawn inspiration from someone else with constant attempts at victimization and a certain amount of jealousy marie is the trigger for most of the arguments that come up out of nowhere each time the two reconcile in the end this is the reason why i felt so much more emotionally invested in the protagonists of marriage story i deeply cared about these characters and their respective lives not only i understood what drove them apart but i could actually relate to some of it malcolm might have made a beautiful movie partially based on his relationship with marie but its still a toxic damaging romance that no one should ever need to deal with even though the beforementioned problems are indeed heavy negatives malcolm marie still possesses a lot of qualities worthy of deep appreciation levinson might share the same views on film criticism as malcolm but his talent as a director is undeniable his brilliant use of excruciatingly long takes plays a significant role in elevating the intensity and attention levels of every dialogue and monologue marcell r vs cinematography  who previously worked with levinson in euphoria  is either based on tracking shots to follow each character across the neverending halls and rooms of the house or static images to let the actors shine in their line deliveries r v waits for just the right moment to finally move the camera near the character after extensive uncut minutes of impressive work from the movies absolute standouts the actors john david washingtons performance in tenet wasnt universally loved and even though i really enjoyed his display i didnt know where his career would go from there well his portrayal of malcolm may be a bit too overthetop for some peoples taste but despite my despise for the character only a blind viewer would not value washingtons outstanding interpretation in a surprisingly more physical display than i anticipated washington literally offers his entire body and voice to his character not forgetting a single facial expression or body movement as uncomfortable as his rants on film criticism are i have to show appreciation for the actors ability to actually make me feel like that nevertheless this is zendayas show in fact i wont be surprised by the inevitable nominations coming her way for someone who never watched euphoria or only has her performance as mj in spiderman homecoming and spiderman far from home as an example her portrayal of marie will surely shock many viewers from the incredible control of subtle emotions certain scenes ask for to the extremely captivating monologues  something both actors tackle superbly  zendaya delivers her careers best performance in a feature film an emotionally powerful display that i wont forget so soon a final praise to labrinths score which plays a meaningful part in the storytelling malcolm marie is technically impressive  gorgeous cinematography and impactful score  boasting two phenomenal performances but its complicated screenplay and characters push me to the negative side from the overly exaggerated almost offensive rants on film criticism and the areas professionals to the tiresome overthetop cycle of fightreconciliation sam levinsons undeniable talent as a director is overpowered by the two incredibly unlikable protagonists who are mutually damaging each other in their unquestionably toxic relationship despite the exceptionally captivating effort from john david washington and especially zendaya who delivers a careerbest interpretation the feeling of discomfort and distress never goes away malcolm is a completely intolerable arrogant filmmaker and even though i genuinely felt sorry for marie at one point the latter eventually proves that shes far from being a better person since one of its central topics of discussion is a bit too niche for general audiences it will probably find its commercial success through netflix personally its my first major disappointment of 2021 ",

    "text": "when i saw the reviews for this movie my first thought was every critic has lost their minds even me the story is about a postapocalyptic wasteland  the fight for survival has twisted the remnants of mankind turning most into mad vicious gangs in this chaotic world two rebels may be able to restore order while seeking their own forms of redemption max a man who just wants peace after losing his wife and child and furiosa  who thinks finding her childhood home is the answer what a lovely day to be talking about mad max fury road because the trailers and the reviews for this movie have been off the walls mad i mean five out of five stars wow just wow the last mad max film came out in 1985 so its a been a long time and so was this movie as development took a long time so i was curious and a bit shady for this movie by seeing if george miller the director of the original films was going to bring to the table now after seeing the movie and having a long thought about it this movie is freaking awesome no actually this is the best action movie of the year and probably the decade george miller goes back to his roots and he doesnt disappointment after all these years later hes still got it he filmed all the action scenes with care and effort because most of the action in this movie are mostly practical effects and that right there shows that miller is going back to old school of action and its perfect you are the man miller the movie itself is mad and i do mean freaking insane theres a guy in this movie who plays a flamethrower electric guitar on top of a speed vehicle and all through out the movie he was rocking it out i dont know why but little things like that made this movie so mad that its enjoyable tom hardy as max rockatansky was good i mean he wasnt as good as mel gibson but i still think he did a great job most of the time max doesnt talk all that much i mean most of hes lines are huh or water but he has a couple of lines in the movie and it sounded epic all the time charlize theron as furiosa is basically the main character and max is the supporting character charlize theron was like a female version of max in a way because her character steels the whole show as her character is a strong female badass that kicks so much ass that its very rare in action movies today to do that now think of all the strong female characters in past action movies well thats furiosa right here the action scenes can be best describe as incredible and freaking crazy the stunt work used during the movie was f king amazing there actually used practical effects mixed with cgi during the action scenes which looked so good and much better than over using effects to make something look incredible and i know they used some cgi for scenes where it needed it because it would be too dangerous or impossible to do but for the most part its all practical effects now this is how action movies should be done thank you mad max fury road for doing this okay i had to get that out there and sorry for shouting immortan joe played by hugh keays byrne  and yes he was in the first mad max movie but here he plays a different villain this time and a menacing one as well he was like a mix of dark vader and sweet tooth from twisted metal video game  he was awesome villain that didnt take sh t from anyone and always looked like he was going to cause a whole lot of trouble every time hes on screen the cinematography was just beautiful and some of the best looking shoots so far this year i cant believe im saying that for a action movie thats been in development for years and it payed off perfectly this is very rare for this to happen as a lot of movie franchises that have been in the making for years and years would normally come out to late where every body just lost interest and give up waiting and the movie itself would turn out not so good but here is much different this movie broke new grounds of coming out late but still being a amazing thrill ride the other women in the movie know as the five wives are not just there to look pretty and be saved by any man no they kicked ass in the movie and they actually did something the five wives were strong women and this isnt just a mans movie i mean most of the movie is the women kicking ass and being awesome they kick more ass then max ever did thats why i got to give this movie praise for that now for the problems i tried to look for things that didnt quite work for the movie and to be honest i couldnt find anything that i thought wasnt good well there was some slow parts in the movie but the slow parts where the action clams down for now it fills its time with character development and back story and it worked overall orget pitch perfect 2 this is the movie you should see at cinema as a movie reviewer myself who wants action movies to be more then turn your brain off and enjoy whatever slob mess there in front of the screen but what i want is a movie experience that i can look back on and say now that was one heck of a movie",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog artemis fowl was the first film exclusively released on disney that i put my eyes on and it will undoubtedly end up as one of the worst movies of 2020 from that moment on i couldnt help but feel a bit skeptical about disney deciding to place films initially intended for a theatrical release in their streaming service which is the case of the one and only ivan the thought did they release it digitally because its awful like the other one couldnt leave my mind so i watched it with moderately low expectations fortunately this flick is one of the sweetest surprises of this year i didnt expect to shed tears in such a generic tale but i did the story follows a familiar formula from the studio but with a few twists the protagonist is the star of a declining show when someone new comes in to save the whole thing making the protagonist jealous however this time the protagonist doesnt try to sabotage anyone to be the main attraction again ivan becomes very close to ruby brooklynn prince and really wants to fulfill a heartfelt promise that he makes to stella to set everyone free mike white who cowrote one of the worst movies of alltime the emoji movie was also a reason for my low confidence levels but i can now forgive him for being part of that other animated atrocity white gives every single character a defining personality or at least a specific trait unique to that animal even side characters with no real impact in the story like henrietta chaka khan  murphy ron funches  or frankie white himself  are clearly stuck in my memory due to their hilarious bits i never imagined i would laugh to a why did the chicken cross the road joke ever again  ivan ruby stella and bob danny devito are undoubtedly the standouts all are characters so easy to fall in love with ivan works beautifully as a protagonist whose backstory is as tragic as one can imagine his arc is incredibly compelling and emotionally powerful so much that it still ends partially sad his relationship with ruby feels authentic and heartfelt just like with stella bob is definitely the funniest of them all but even he has a story of abandonment and isolation every wild animal deserves freedom and every domestic animal deserves a family home thats a message ill always stand by and fight for as an animal lover the highest praise i can offer this film is that it feels surprisingly immersive even when watching at home when ivan talked i never thought thats sam rockwell i always looked and heard ivan as ivan same with every other character the animals look impressively realistic but movie magic reached a point where i cant even tell the difference between a real animal and a fake one sometimes its not really the case of the one and only ivan but after the lion king something like the former doesnt really surprise me anymore still it just goes to show how storytelling can be the headliner i was so enthralled by the narrative that i couldnt care less about the visually stunning animals nor the excellent voice acting i just wanted to see the animals be set free finally two more impactful aspects that made the film better for me craig armstrongs score is exceptionally prone to chills and tears its subtle when it needs to be and powerfully moving when the big moments arrive one of my favorite scores of 2020 the last detail has to do with the movies inception dont ask me why but i missed the inspired by a true story at the opening credits as usual in this type of films right after these end text accompanies photos and clips in this case of the reallife ivan in an otherwise generic movie i was emotionally shocked once i saw those real images i finish the film with tears of happiness but i have to leave a disclaimer when it comes to negatives this is one of those movies where i cant really point out straightup flaws or technical issues my only nitpick is that id have loved to see more development regarding ivan and macks bryan cranston supposedly strong bond that they share as a family it doesnt detract from the touching moments between the two but it could have made those sequences much more impactful its simply a fun entertaining fastpaced onehourandahalf flick that works for both adults and children however even though theres no visible violence or animal abuse some of the animal characters share their sorrowful traumatic past which can be a tad too dark for really young kids the one and only ivan is one of the most loving surprises of 2020 boasting an impeccable cast and one of my favorite scores of the year this adaptation of ivans true story might follow a slightly changed generic formula but its undoubtedly an emotional journey worthy of everyones attention both adults and children mike white delivers a heartfelt screenplay packed with memorable animal characters easy to connect with even for viewers who arent animal lovers a beautiful story filled with meaningful messages and tearinducing moments executed so brilliantly that it became one of my most immersive home viewings of the last few years visually i cant point out a single issue the animals look incredible if i needed an argument to convince friends and family to subscribe to disney  this is the movie id show them ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my reviews please follow my blog  first of all this is obviously a spoiler review i mean who hasnt seen this movie yet if by some extraordinary circumstances youre one of those unlucky souls stop spend the next hour and a half watching this animated masterpiece and come back here i will still avoid mentioning key details because im just used to it and the lion king has so many things to compliment that i dont really need to get indepth on spoilers so in case you havent notice it through my twitter or occasional mentions in other reviews the lion king is one of my favorite films of alltime animated or not  i rewatched it for the 312358th time this last weekend and i cried more than when i was just a child thats how much this movie means to me the sense of nostalgia plus the overwhelming emotions throughout the runtime are tearinducing aspects that i cant simply avoid i literally cried waterfalls in four  different scenes the opening sequence circle of life filled my eyes with nostalgias tears mufasas tragic moment obviously wrecked me one of the most emotionally powerful scenes in the history of cinema  simba receiving the whole remember who you are speech from mufasa in the clouds is incredibly inspirational and therefore worthy of some sobbing finally one of the last scenes simba climbing his way to the top of pride rock with hans zimmers score leaving me absolutely destroyed and i want to pick up on that last aspect the score its one of the most crucial technical features of a film in my opinion it can transform an okay scene into something magical or something pretty terrible depending on what kind of score it is consequently it can make a good movie turn into a great one hans zimmer is one of my favorite composers ever his soundtracks are always filled with such an epic vibe even if the film itself isnt that good his scores are still able to elevate it in some way the lion king is one of his most memorable scores due to how emotionally compelling it is even in the subtlest moments during the stampede sequence the score doesnt lend you time to breathe its high rhythm and continuously growing music keep any viewer at the edge of the seat waiting for it to be over then when simba descends and approaches his dad the score is so subtle completely opposite to the previous sumptuous and grand sound its that nuance plus the impact of the scene itself that make me cry in the last scene that i mentioned above its solely the score that brings in the chillinducing tears if simba climbed pride rock with no soundtrack it would just be a good ending however from the exact moment that the score fades in it instantly turns that sequence into an epic finale the slowmotion walk to the top the immersive score simbas roar damn it im crying again the animation is some of disneys best its not by chance that the disney renaissance era 19891999  which was the return to form by disney has the best animation quality of its history and a lot of the memorable movies that marked everyones childhood its expressiveness and ease to make animals emote elevates the story and its characters theres no need for any kind of dialogue when you can see how the characters are reacting and understand what theyre feeling the wide shots are beautiful to look at and worthy of being anyones wallpaper even today the songs are remarkable and they influenced an entire generation can you feel the love tonight circle of life be prepared hakuna matata every single song is someones favorite the voice work is perfect james earl jones gives such an outstanding vocal performance that even when discussing his careers biggest role darth vader isnt the obvious choice jeremy irons and his raspy voice elevate scar as the villainous character if you close your eyes and only hear every characters voice without having watched the film previously you can easily identify whos the bad guy and thats unbelievably good everyone else is amazing but these two gentlemen are astonishing and they deserve to be remembered forever as the voices of these iconic roles nevertheless in the end the two pillars of every movie always matter the most story and characters the lion king has an especially compelling screenplay one that teaches its viewers how to handle loss but also how to grow up and overcome our worst fears its true that most people cry watching this film but those same people are filled with joy by the end because they accompanied simbas journey from being a reckless and innocent cub to becoming the king that everyone needed while also making his father extremely proud even though its a very tragic movie timon and pumbaa are two hilarious characters that keep bringing some sense of happiness by delivering some wellneeded laughs their laidback lifestyle is something that everyone desires but when you have responsibilities you cant just hide from them you must learn how to be what everyone needs you to be without losing the essence of who you are its a masterpiece it doesnt matter if its an animated film it doesnt matter if it was made for kids people need to stop looking at animated flicks as something juvenile that only children can watch while parents can do something else if parents watched this kind of inspirational animated movies as well maybe the world would be a better place the lion king is one of my favorite films of alltime and its undeniably one of disneys best original movies from the gorgeous animation to the beautiful score from the emotionally compelling story to the life journey simba goes through from the chillinducing tearful moments to the loud laughs the lion king is just perfect hopefully its liveaction remake will keep its essence and deliver these feelings once again  ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog 2020 brings us yet another disneys liveaction remake after new versions of the jungle book aladdin the lion king and many others now comes the time for mulan therefore i decided to go back in time and relive one of the latest installments of the disney renaissance era as a kid even though i was and i still am far from being someone impacted by the chinese culture i always enjoyed the movie for its story characters and of course its memorable score however for some reason it never became one of those disney classics i revisit every year this might very well be only my 5th time watching this film which for someone born in the 90s like me feels weirdly short this is probably the first time i watch mulan since i was an innocent young teenager so i was definitely intrigued to see if my overall opinion would change a lot or not well enough of the suspense i love it i appreciate it a lot more than when i was a kid without a single doubt in fact if i could only choose one movie to be remade in the liveaction format mulan would be my ultimate choice simply due to its epic and cinematic feel not trying to take away from the compelling story and incredible characters but when it comes to liveaction mulan has everything to deliver a chillinducing visual spectacle this film proves how 2d animation can feel so powerful and emotionally overwhelming as with every movie from the disney renaissance era the animation looks gorgeous dozens of jawdropping shots resemble the epic scope of lord of the rings the action sequences are incredibly riveting and innovative placing the main character in situations where she needs to act smart jerry goldsmiths music plays a vital part in the narrative not only it develops characters in a meaningful way but it helps the story move forward with fun and entertaining songs once again the action set pieces are also elevated by this score which offers a whole other cinematic layer technically mulan is one of disneys best animated flicks ever however as usual the two pillars of any film are what people end up saving in their hearts and memory story and characters with so many writers attached to screenplay credits im genuinely surprised mulan has such a wellwritten wellstructured emotionally resonating narrative packed with culturally significant storylines its hard not to feel enthralled by mulans mingna wen arc a daughter who goes to war by stealing her old fathers spot protecting him from certain death while also trying to honor her family a woman who wants to be more than just a wife to some man fighting against the menacing shanyu miguel ferrer and his army but also against condescending stereotypes and ancient society rules mingna wen gives mulan a powerful voice worth remembering after more than twenty years her journey is still an inspiring tale not only to every woman and young girl on the planet but to everyone who lays eyes on this movie captain li shang bd wong also has his own arc of trying to prove himself worthy of being called captain against all the odds he still trains his troops and honors his own father ling gedde watanabe  yao harvey fierstein  and chienpo jerry tondo are hilarious but also essential to help save china from the enemy shanyu works perfectly as an intimidating presence even though his motivations follow the generic villain formula now prepare yourselves because my only issue with the film might be a hot take im sure that as a kid i loved mushu and all of his jokes he also has a compelling storyline in the same way as other characters however watching the film now i can only hear eddie murphy perform a few jokes like a standup routine when i listen to mushu i dont think oh thats mushu i think thats eddie murphy its a remarkably somber dark movie to match disneys trademark humor so the tones balance must be perfect for it to work mushu might bring the necessary levity with a lighthearted joke here and there but overall hes the main reason why sometimes the film loses track of when to take things seriously and when to be funny all in all mulan is one of the most culturally significant animated classics that disney possesses even after two decades its story inspires every single person who sets eyes in this magnificent piece of cinema its emotionally compelling narrative is packed with epic action sequences elevated by a memorable score which also helps develop characters and carry the story forward the eponymous characters arc still resonates with many people today a journey of proving ones selfworth family and breaking stereotypes with a terrific voice cast almost every character holds a captivating storyline with their own clear motivations visually it has a cinematic feel that no other disney animated flick owns tonally the balance could be better the tragic somber dark war is present throughout the whole runtime and while some levity and humor are definitely welcome some jokes stand out as unnecessary and eddie murphys mushu is way too silly during certain moments having in mind the target audience one cant complain too much its a little nitpick in an otherwise phenomenal movie one that i recommend to every reader so that you can all be inspired by it like so many people all around the world ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog aaron sorkin has been around for quite some time a few good men moneyball steve jobs and arguably one of the best movies of the last decade the social network all have one thing in common sorkin as a screenwriter but not as the director mollys game was sorkins directorial debut which makes the trial of the chicago 7 only his second time in the directors chair ive either loved or liked every film from him so obviously my expectations were already high enough solely due to his presence however with the announcement of such a stellar cast its impossible not to expect one of the best movies of the year to come out of this project expectations fulfilled this is in fact one of 2020s very best films without the shadow of a doubt based on real events the movie quickly jumps to the main point of action the trial only twenty minutes in the viewer is already inside the famous courtroom where the expected and the unexpected occur simultaneously sorkins employs a narrative structure that keeps me captivated until the final credits start to roll the actions that led to this court case are demonstrated throughout the same instead of being shown through a linear timeline which would reduce the trials value its the main reason why such a simple premise turns into a phenomenal adaptation of the historical event i couldnt take my eyes offscreen for a single second or lose one of the many incredible dialogues every conversation every argument every objection overrule or motion denied is transmitted to the viewer in an exceptionally captivating manner its one of those movies where the action belongs to words instead of fists i felt tremendously invested in the trial it never loses a gram of interest its fullon exciting all the time i desperately wanted to find out the result of the case i didnt possess knowledge of the real story but ill address this further down  i really wanted to witness the events that put the defendants in their respective positions i strongly desired to see the end of the situation as soon as the film ends i felt the urge to immediately research everything about the true story i spent close to fortyfive minutes reading many articles about the 1968 democratic national convention the riots the presidential nominees everything this is one of the most important criteria i have to define how successful a historical flick truly is how much does it compel me to research everything about it the trial of the chicago 7 convinces me to study the real events with significant impact from what ive read sorkin changes a few details timelinewise something pretty common in this type of movie  but overall its a pretty accurate realistic adaptation technically every component is remarkable as expected from a netflixsorkin partnership however the score plays a special part since its volume in crescendo elevates several escalating situations leaving me at the edge of my couch biting my nails its a fantastic achievement from daniel pemberton who also scored birds of prey and enola holmes this year additionally this might not be a onelocation film but sorkin keeps the camera so focused on the courtroom that it feels like the audience is stuck in there with the defendants besides sorkins screenplay the cast obviously plays a massive role just like i mentioned above this is a movie where the action is played out through words inside the courtroom there are constant arguments countless contempts of court a voir dire it doesnt hurt to google courtroom terminology before the film  and so much more that leads the judge to make questionable decisions based on shocking evidence every actor is absolutely outstanding i was able to feel everything during that trial but i do have four standouts sacha baron cohen abbie hoffman shares the laugh spotlight with jeremy strong jerry rubin  but he ends up being the ultimate comic relief his delivery and timing are pure gold i cant deny that i was surprised by his performance since ive only seen him in borat hes extremely funny but dont be mistaken by my words abbie proves to be one of the most essential defendants in the trial offering a memorable testimony and demonstrating his real purpose eddie redmayne brings his oscarwinner face to the game by interpreting tom hayden a vital character that lets the viewer know that while they might not all be completely guilty theyre not all exactly innocent as well haydens final speech is one of redmaynes best scenes of his career mark rylance plays the role of the public portraying the defendants lawyer william kunstler he shares the viewers frustration with the judges decisions but never gives up trying to bring justice to the case if i had to bet on an actor to get awards buzz by the end of the year it would be rylance due to his powerful display my last standout is frank langella as the judge julius hoffman i believe a lot of people will give credit to every actor for portraying characters they love but most will forget the actor that interprets the character everyone hates langella deserves all of the praise in the world for making me despise completely such an unfair racist unqualified judge his performance is simply extraordinary these are my four standouts but the entire cast is phenomenal im a bit disappointed that i didnt get to see more from yahya abdulmateen ii bobby seale  but after researching bobbys involvement in this story i understand his lack of relevance to the main narrative he plays more of a modern parallel to the 60s in the sense that the judge heavily discriminates against him during the trial transmitting a message that humanitys behavior may have evolved regarding racism but theres still a long way to go a final shoutout to joseph gordonlevitt who is also excellent as richard schultz i only have one issue in terms of entertainment the viewer entering the main stage after only twenty minutes is a bold yet efficient move however the introduction to the characters and the story itself goes by so fast that i could only understand whos who and their purpose during the trial sorkin assumes people know everything about who these characters are what they did and where the narrative is driving towards skipping through dozens of details that mostly nonamerican audiences will struggle to understand in time sorkin could have given these characters more depth initially offering the viewer time to get familiar with their names and organizations all in all the trial of the chicago 7 is undoubtedly one of the best movies of the year probably the best at the date of this review aaron sorkins narrative structure and the brilliant cast are the two main reasons why this film succeeds so well sorkins screenplay is organized in a way that keeps the viewer astonishingly captivated throughout the entire runtime by following a nonlinear structure maintaining the focus on a single location is an exceptional decision for a movie where words are the action of the story inside the courtroom is where every fascinating argument ensues never losing steam until the very end its also a lot funnier than i expected regarding the cast sacha baron cohen mark rylance eddie redmayne and frank langella are my standouts but every actor delivers outstanding performances daniel pembertons score shines in an overall very wellproduced film the first twenty minutes fly by in favor of entertainment by quickly placing the viewer inside the courtroom but its so rushed that it makes it difficult for the audience to remember everyones names and purposes assuming everyone knows the true story and the people involved is a risky move especially for nonamericans nevertheless this minor issue doesnt affect an otherwise flawless movie obviously i strongly recommend it maybe reading a bit about the real events beforehand will help the eventual viewing but dont read too much due to the usual spoilers ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog the 101 dalmatians franchise is one of those disney properties that is always broadcasted across all main television networks during holidays in my country usually during christmas the liveaction films of 1996 and 2000 are stored somewhere in my memory even though i never really sat down and watched the movies all by myself cruella might just be another liveaction film from the mickey mouse studio but its far from being yet another remake much on the contrary just like the vast majority of the companys villains cruella de vil portrayed by glenn close in the previous installments was even worse than the generic antagonist with cliche motivations that eventually every studio used and reused to exhaustion besides cruellas greedy necessities purely evil personality and extreme vanity this wicked character was driven by something completely unthinkable skinning shorthaired puppies to have more success in the fashion industry due to their soft fur anyone with a conscience knows that disney would never bring this character back to the big screen in 2021 without making some changes especially regarding this motivation in particular how would a movie with a dogkilling protagonist at its front and center be remotely successful obviously this hardcore motif no longer belongs to emma stones cruellas defining character traits which might be a nono for those viewers who are more protective of the original material as if times and culture didnt change from decade to decade since the start of disneys liveaction remakes campaign audiences have been divided about how to feel and what to expect from these films some wish for a copypaste version of the same story while others desire a completely different take on the wellknown narrative however the best experience  and the primary goal of these movies  is a mix of both a version that keeps the essence and the message of the original while bringing something new and different to the table to justify its existence cruella isnt a remake but an origin al story based on a classic villain and its undoubtedly one of the best films ive seen this year until this day i didnt expect to write an extensive review but with so much to address i know my thoughts will take a while to transcribe to this article let me start with some easy elements that everyone can see and enjoy without having to go into deep analysis mode the costume design is indisputably the technical standout the colorfully stunning dresses steal the show visually but its how it differentiates estella and cruella that jenny beavan shines in her job just from what stone wears the viewers can easily decipher what character shes playing the differences between the glamorous rich people that the baroness surrounds herself with and the dirty poor friends estella meets at the beginning of the movie  jasper joel fry and horace paul walter hauser  is also accentuated through their wardrobes the extravagant parties are packed with oscarworthy costumes but also with beautiful makeup hair nadia stacey and absolutely ravishing production design fiona crombie  nicholas britells score carries little references to the music of the other installments as does the film itself craig gillespie doesnt hide the easter eggs spread throughout the runtime of which some will definitely please the most avid fans technically its as gorgeous as one came to expect from the studio but not everything is as impressive as the aspects above in a movie where even the blackandwhite hair and clothes of cruella pop off the screen the cgi backgrounds and animals are way too noticeable for the studio that just made a hyperrealistic remake of the lion king cgi dogs are employed during most of the runtime which is not only understandable but also commendable animal violence in filmmaking is a serious topic that fortunately was solved long ago however the vfx dont look good enough causing the dogs  mainly the dalmatians  to be an unintended distraction in addition to this a specific outdoor location thats quite important to the story is surrounded by an awfully dark fake background that just feels way too off finally the ending boasts a ridiculous sequence made with terrible cgi that will definitely leave the more logicdriven viewers stunned with disappointment i consider this a nitpick especially since its not a film without silliness in fact cruellas success partially rests on gillespies tone balance jasper and horace become the comicrelief characters starring in the absurd action sequences that occur at parties and other places they decide to steal from now some people might expect that since the other movies are defined by their irrational fun however dana fox and tony mcnamaras screenplay carries undeniable similarities to the devil wears prada and the most recent joker estellas life story is far from being a happy tale and cruellas rise even less overall the balance between the silly comedy and the more dramatic depressing traumatic storyline is mostly wellhandled but there are a few moments where gillespie lets it too loose especially in the overdisneyish last fifteen minutes so lets address the two protagonists estella and cruella the comparisons with joaquin phoenixs take on arthur fleck joker are impossible to unsee from the upbringing filled with bullying and family tragedy to the final transformation emma stones character follows a similar arc but with clear differences concerning the solution for her problems estella dreams of being a fashion designer and idolizes the selfcentered selfindulgent baroness which takes her down a learning path of how to be successful in the business the baroness despicable treatment of estella brings the ruthless cruella gradually back to life eventually stealing the spotlight from the lovely little estella who just wanted to do what she loved for a living without having to carry on extreme measures an unexpected clever twist pretty much completes the protagonists transformation which genuinely caught me by surprise i admit that i didnt have high hopes for this origin story nevertheless the wellwritten screenplay deeply explores a previously hollow villain offering her a touching backstory and comprehensible motivations while its true that she possesses dozens of identical characteristics to the infamous baroness cruella never truly becomes 100 that person honestly i wouldnt mind seeing a sequel but i dont think theres room for another film that wouldnt hurt the one we just got so theres just one more aspect to delve into the casts performances joel fry and paul walter hauser are truly hilarious as the famous duo of thieves both share a compelling connection to estella one that i believe deserved a better conclusion they become a family living and stealing throughout their lives but when estella starts giving cruella some screentime a few issues arise within the trio these problems are indeed approached and solved but in a less dramatic manner than i hoped for fry is excellent as the more competent rational jasper but hauser never stops being extremely funny the beforementioned balance is rarely affected by the characters comedic banter which is something the actors also deserve credit for emma thompson delivers one of my favorite performances of her recent filmography interpreting the baroness von hellman how can you make an extremely overthetop character feel cartoonish yet strangely real someone who clearly feels like an exaggeration of a stereotype but still resembles dozens of people from the real world thompson takes her role and the only reason why she doesnt steal the spotlight from everyone else is because the other emma rises to the challenge of portraying such a classic villain with obvious references to miranda priestly from the devil wears prada thompson is able to be amusing and vile in the same scene making every second with her on screen feel incredibly captivating nevertheless emma stone manages to stay a level above everyone else i firmly believe that shes one of the best actresses of her generation carrying one of the most expressive faces in hollywood stone was born to play a protagonist with two personalities without looking at the screen any viewer will be able to know if shes talking as estella or cruella not only she changes the tone of her voice depending on the character but the mannerisms alter as well it would be a massive surprise if such an early disney performance got an oscar nomination so her chances are obviously thin however if there was an award for best monologue stone would be a strong contender i dont recall how many minutes it really is but i cant forget that long uncut take with stone at the center of the screen with nothing but her acting the hell out of an emotionally impactful monologue switching between estella and cruella in the span of milliseconds her microexpressions elevate a heartfelt characterdefining speech that will undoubtedly mark this year of cinema stone gives not one but two impressive attentiongrabbing performances that will satisfy most viewers looking for a cruella they can understand and even root for cruella is not only one of 2021s biggest surprises but its also one of the best movies of the year so far despite the occasional lack of balance between the silly comedy and the dramatic narrative craig gillespie offers an incredibly captivating origin al story about one of disneys classic villains dana fox and tony mcnamaras remarkable screenplay profoundly explores the estellacruella transformation giving her nondogkilling emotionally compelling motivations a traumatic depressing past and an unexpected twist that will probably catch most viewers offguard with one of her best performances ever emma stone delivers an awardworthy display interpreting two personalities in impressive fashion stealing the spotlight from the other outstanding interpretations technically the distracting cgi in animals and some noticeable greenscreen dont overcome the predictably oscarwinning stunning costume design as well as the gorgeous makeup hair wonderful production design and sweet score packed with excellent song choices a character study that makes this one of disneys best liveaction films in the last couple of decades ",

incredible performances strongly grasp me to the screen every single time so i expected i care a lot to follow the same path from the most recent radioactive to one of her most famous roles in gone girl passing through numerous other memorable displays pike just cant deliver a bad interpretation being this my first viewing of a j blakesons movie and with netflix offering their pristine production value i must state that im surprised with how much i thoroughly enjoyed this film let me begin with what i think really makes this movie so attractive its screenplay pike and co all deliver outstanding performances and ill get to those but blakesons script is both crazy and smart if the premise isnt clear enough capitalism is a significant theme throughout the entire runtime from the richpoor depressing yet realistic comparisons to the ruthless competition between the socalled sharks of this economic system i care a lot provides excellent parallelism to the real world the notthatimplicit messages regarding this topic are mostly delivered by marla grayson a protagonist who doesnt shy away from assuming her lioness status possessing cunning knowledge of both the pros and cons of capitalism and its borderline legal cheats the viewer accompanies marla through her exceptionally captivating process of acquiring and profiting from a new target just like hundreds of companies and ceos around the world do without most people realizing it when marla finds a worthy competitor blakeson risks its grounded story replacing it with an absolutely lunatic second half characterized by absurd outofthisworld character and plot decisions which would be a major issue if its purpose wasnt precisely to show the ridiculous  and criminal  ambition of toptier capitalists i cant deny it gets a tad too mad and irrational for my taste but having in mind the context and blakesons goal i consider it a mostly successful play plus the entertainment value doesnt drop much on the contrary it skyrockets to a point where i welcome some of its craziness the third act boasts tremendous tension and suspense slightly unexpected developments and a shocking yet utterly perfect ending that will make most viewers say karma is a b tch right its a quite enlightening story about the reallife guardians who exploit their wards blakeson brilliantly educates the audience on the power of bureaucracy the moral compromises overly ambitious people must make and how to profit for some means lack of freedom for others marc canhams score is the technical standout delivering an electronic soundtrack that i usually dont appreciate that much but it played the right type of tracks at the perfect moments from the score alone the viewer is able to understand the importance of certain scenes and thats a massive achievement doug emmetts cinematography also allows for a few gorgeous shots with exquisite lighting but i need to move on to the fantastic performances from the cast i already approached pikes performance and at the time of this review shes already received a golden globe nomination so i dont need to further compliment her display however i cant let the rest of the cast go away without mentions peter dinklage three billboards outside ebbing missouri avengers infinity war offers one of my favorite performances from his film career with his slightly overthetop yet intriguing interpretation of a dangerous gangster eiza gonz lez bloodshot hobbs shaw alita battle angel is also pretty good as fran marlas lover and her chemistry with pike is onpoint their sparse yet impactful emotional moments are quite compelling dianne wiest is a total badass as jennifer peterson a notthatinnocent old lady and finally a shoutout to chris messina birds of prey  who hands his charm as an attentiongrabbing lawyer i care a lot is one of the best netflix movies this year has offered so far boasting an intriguing premise j blakeson brilliantly expands his idea through an enlightening screenplay that tackles the sometimes cunning guardianward relationship in reallife packed with clever analogies to reallife capitalism blakeson transmits impactful messages about the power of authority excessive ambition and the moral compromises one makes to gain wealth and success at the cost of other peoples freedom rosamund pike impeccably leads a film that starts as a realistic take on the process of acquiring and profiting from a new victim and then evolves into an absolutely crazy second half of absurd outcomes this ridiculous development does get a bit too irrational but its purposeful objective of demonstrating capitalists immorally ruthless behavior regarding competition is undoubtedly accomplished outstanding performances across the board and a surprisingly effective electronic score only make this movie better i couldnt recommend it more ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog i still cant believe im about to write a review for the new mutants the last xmen movie before theyre introduced into the mcu became one of the most delayed films ever but it finally got released this week shot in 2017 with an original release date of april 2018 josh boone had reshoots planned which postponed the movie for the first time disney began negotiations to merge with 20th century fox now 20th century studios  keeping the film in a limbo state a global pandemic emerged pushing the movie even further final outcome a worldwide limited release three years after finishing shooting and without any reshoots so obviously my expectations were pretty low surprise surprise the new mutants isnt a horrible mess its fine i feel really sorry that so many people worked on this film and had to wait so long to see it being released to the world i love how its far from being just another generic formulaic superhero flick sure it has tons of cliches and it does still feel like an xmen movie at times but ill get there i genuinely appreciate that boone and knate lee wrote a narrative packed with significant and detailed character development including a compelling romantic arc every young mutant gets their own story explained frontcenter each time the film dives into a characters past it never feels like an irrelevant subplot it all serves a purpose the technical crew had a very low budget to work with compared to other movies in the genre so i must praise them for transforming a small onelocation film into something surprisingly entertaining the visual effects definitely dont have that quality that viewers are used to seeing now but theyre reasonably okay for the most part the horror atmosphere is definitely present but it feels like the movie could have benefited from a more assertive bolder approach to these nightmarish sequences the best aspect of the whole film is related to the indisputably talented cast with just one exception from anyataylor joys rebel behavior to charlie heatons experienced performance passing through maisie williams emotional display and henry zagas charming oneliners every one of these actors proves why they were cast in such a wellknown franchise despite the ridiculously flawed accents all share great chemistry between each other including debutant blu hunt however the latter fails to be a compelling protagonist clearly due to her inexperience i dont want to be too harsh on her because i did see some great moments when she shared the screen with her colleagues however i do need to state that every scene where she acts alone or against a green screen reaches cringeworthy levels of bad acting boone and or the casting crew must also take responsibility for choosing her as the main character but honestly shes not even my main issue that has to do with her own character while she gets the same focus as her fellow mutants when it comes to her backstory she never really has to deal with her powers consequences some mutants hurt or killed people and theyre unquestionably damaged because of it dani doesnt have a single moment where she feels sorry for whatever happened in her past or where shes confronted with it its quite hard to connect with a protagonist when both the character and the actress playing her lack that captivating personality finally alice braga as the doctor is probably the most formulaic component of the movie from the first conversation she has with the mutants any viewer can guess where the story is going braga is good as dr cecilia reyes but coincidentally or not her character is the only one whose backstory wasnt remotely explored reyes motivations and what lies beyond the hospital raise intriguing questions that unfortunately never get answered maybe the supposed reshoots could have solved some of these issues perhaps they could have added some more i dont know for sure but what i do know is that the new mutants is far from being an awful mess all in all josh boone and knate lee deliver a reasonably entertaining screenplay out of the generic zone of the superhero genre packed with detailed character development and decent horror sequences especially having in mind the low budget the new mutants features a marvelous cast where everyone shares tremendous chemistry with each other all actors deliver great performances except for the debutant blu hunt who unfortunately lets her inexperience overcome her evident potential contrasting with the overall character treatment dani moonstar fails to be a compelling protagonist since shes barely shown having to deal with the emotional consequences of her powers like every other mutant does despite the refreshing take on the overall story there are still a few cliches and formulaic components throughout the film especially related to the hospital overall its surprisingly okay considering the numerous production issues so i definitely recommend it at least just to say goodbye to the last xmen installment premcu ",

gerard bush and christopher renz feature directorial debuts deliver quite a shocking film depicting racism and slavery in unpleasant yet realistic ways this last part is precisely the seamless balance that every movie needs to have when dealing with these themes and in my opinion bush and renz didnt really nail it the brutal torture and death sequences that black people suffer in this film are shown without any restraint from massive amounts of blood to visible hits its one of those movies that carries so much realism that it becomes uncomfortable if these scenes end up carrying a meaningful message or a compelling arc it might be hard to watch but it ultimately feels necessary and emotionally impactful if they dont then it just looks like violence for the sake of entertainment which will always bother a lot of viewers depending on the type of violence on display bush and renz risk the films success walking this thin line and overall even though theyre far from perfecting that balance they didnt do a bad job at all in fact for a directorial debut antebellum is technically remarkable opening with an uncut long opening sequence where the camera shows the entire plantation passing through the recent arrival of janelle mon es character and finishing in a horrendous slowmotion treatment of a desperate slave trying to escape these six to eight minutes function like a disclaimer to the audience if people feel way too disturbed by what theyve just witnessed then its better to leave this one on the side and forget about it pedro luques cinematography feels definitely unique and it never shies away from displaying whats happening no matter how gruesome and terrible the musical score from nate wonder and roman gianarthur characterized by its dominant use of strings elevates so many suspenseful moments honestly its pretty addictive to listen to great production value as expected costume and set design are fantastic visually i find nothing to complain about even judging the brutality solely on itself if the purpose is to demonstrate how much slaves suffered back then its as faithful as it could be storywise bush and renz need to improve their quality as screenwriters their premise is extremely convincing the nonlinear narrative structure adds a neat mystery and the story itself is incredibly intriguing however instead of reaching its undeniable potential and delivering a phenomenal profound welldeveloped screenplay antebellum ends up in a predictable manner leaving tons of interesting storylines to explore even its climactic actionheavy final minutes are underwhelming and every problem is solved way too easily it even gives the viewer the right to question why and how everything that happens in the movie could in fact occur for so long nevertheless its far from being a trainwreck much on the contrary i was invested until the very end almost every scene is captivating to the point of me staying completely still without taking my eyes off the screen i didnt feel too uncomfortable with the display of violence so my experience was smoother than most people id assume the excellent representation of janelle mon es characters distinct lifestyles in the plantation and in the city is the best aspect of the entire film clearly setting up a different color palette and tone mon e offers a powerful performance carrying the whole movie on her shoulders as the sole protagonist of an incredibly heavy story all in all antebellum is set to divide viewers due to its uncomfortable yet realistic extreme violence gerard bush and christopher renz deliver an undeniably shocking film involving hardtowatch depictions of torture slavery and racism technically the camera work gives the whole movie a distinct style as well as its score costumes and set design janelle mon e demonstrates her acting abilities as the protagonist delivering an emotionally captivating display the nonlinear narrative structure elevates the central mystery but the story doesnt receive the extensive treatment that its premise deserves the enormous potential is wasted in meaningless horrific deaths just as in the third acts disappointing action sequences while the whiteonblack violence is justified in the context of the film its excessive unrestrained display without a convincing message or arc surrounding it is definitely a negative aspect that some people wont be able to accept i didnt feel bothered to that level and i still believe the intent was benign so i recommend this directorial debut from bush and renz but with a disclaimer for the sensitive subject matter and or viewers who struggle with depictions of intense violence ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog  heres the thing about the fast furious franchise it can be dumb fun every movie has the right to be entertaining even if it completely disregards physics and logic as long as it establishes its tone from the start you cant make an action film where the main characters survive basically everything they shouldnt and take everything seriously its not that you cant have that mix of tones furious 7 did it brilliantly  but thats reserved for some of the best movies of the year since its not easy at all to balance so many different things hobbs shaw sets its tone in the first 10 minutes and everyone knows what theyre getting themselves into however it didnt quite work for me this time the fast furious saga is an undeniable success even more in my country where it constantly breaks boxoffice records it possesses everything a popcorn blockbuster should have tons of action car chases explosions fights shootouts  easytofollow plot and simple character development theres no problem in leaving your brain at the entrance of the theater for a couple of hours and just have fun of course hobbs shaw is ridiculous its completely absurd it has no sense of logic and its unbelievable how many physicsdefying sequences occur but thats exactly what they establish in those first few minutes so people just need to sit comfortably and eat that whole bag of popcorn while watching the most ludicrous action onscreen so if the tone is wellbalanced why didnt i enjoy it as much as the rest people seem to be having tremendous fun even critics who usually demolish this type of films are liking it  so i guess im in the minority here but i just found the action pretty underwhelming and the comedy was way off for me granted there are huge set pieces and there are a couple of great action scenes especially a motorbikecar chase between brixton hobbs and shaw true there are a couple of laughs that i couldnt contain due to how amazing statham and johnsons chemistry is nevertheless overall i just dont think its enough first of all my main issue with the story brixton idris elba is incredible as always and i really want him to be the next james bond however his character is so poorly written and so horribly explored that i wonder why they made him an enhanced machine with superpowers literally theres no difference between him and the other two main characters which ultimately destroys the superhero vibe elba should have thats the problem with having such an absurd movie if your heroes are undefeatable due to their enormous plot armor how is your superpowered villain different than them if an explosion goes off with the three of them close why do hobbs and shaw survive in the same way brixton does how does a punch from a black superman has the same impact as a punch from the other two then the comedy its not like i disliked statham and johnson bantering for five straight minutes in three different scenes its just too long and not all of the jokes land the film itself is way too long just over two hours if i didnt know about the whole samoa sequence from occasionally seeing it on a tv spot i would have believed the movie was about to end when it started its third act it feels like its going to end but then theres a whole other massive action set piece to show off for the first time in a long long time i almost fell asleep during the transition from the secondtolast to the last action moment the action is also very disappointing having in mind david leitch is directing too many quick cuts and way too choppy finally theres an attempt at the start of a romance that i wont spoil but its not like its forced because it actually isnt it follows a logical path characters dont say stupid stuff to each other and it was surprisingly being a good way of stopping to breathe and relax away from all the action however as the film reaches its conclusion they ditch it altogether and never address it anymore theres even a line similar to ill let you have a kiss tomorrow if were still alive but they never go there again its like it never happened why the only thing that was truly being logical and emotionally compelling is completely ignored by the end thats disappointing i dont want to be too harsh on the movie because i do understand how entertaining and fun it might be im sure audiences will love it and fans of the franchise will love it even more the chemistry of the cast is palpable and everyone is terrific dwayne johnson and jason statham are awesome as the action superstars and theyre definitely the main source of entertainment vanessa kirby is also pretty great and i have to commend the film for keeping two spectacular cameos under wraps you wont believe whos in this movie as well there are still a couple of cool action sequences and i did laugh more than a couple of times so i guess it isnt as bad as this review might transmit i know im in the minority so i recommend all of you to go watch it and judge it for yourselves if you enjoy absurdity ridiculousness and overthetop action as well as cheesy comedy hobbs shaw might be perfect for you it didnt really work for me though the comedy was not as good as i expected the action is not that captivating and brixton is such a horribly written and unexplored character that i kept feeling frustrated every time an action sequence ended go for the huge set pieces and the dumb fun stay for the amazing casts chemistry ps if you havent watched game of thrones by now heavy spoilers in this film youve been warned ",

psychiatrist dr karen fletcher betty buckley  knows 23 of them but theres one hidden from everyone who desires to dominate over all the others compelled by one of his personalities kevin abducts three girls where casey cooke anya taylorjoy becomes their leader to try and escape the crazy man is this the return to form by m night shyamalan who has been struggling for more than a decade to release a major success is split the movie that brings him back to the spotlight once again shyamalans storytelling is very original unconventional and ultimately mindblowing instead of establishing everything the audience needs to know about the characters right at the beginning he gradually develops them giving them haunting backstories and spreading parts of it throughout the runtime that said this film isnt for everyone the audience needs to trust shyamalan and be patient really patient dont start taking notes about something that you think its negative because once you reach the third act everything changes and suddenly it all makes sense the screenplay is not as twisty as unbreakable for example but it demands absolute attention in order to catch up on all the things that matter and the ones that dont as well  the production and editing team have to be congratulated due to their seamless work from the camera work to the extended onetake sequences as well as the environment surrounding the characters everything feels real and looks amazing the soundtrack  let me just say that this element is so but so much relevant to the conclusion of this movie i cant really say anything else without spoiling the ending so ill leave a note after my rating at the end of the review with a major spoiler as for the cast ill start with the man that i honestly think should have received an oscar nomination james mcavoy you know theres a big difference in portraying a nonfiction character instead of a fiction one concerning the former you cant really escape the true nature of the person you are playing but with the latter as an actor actress you have to deliver yourself 100 to the role for it to be believable  and god does mcavoy deliver he gives 200 in what could be his best performance to date do you think andy serkis had problems portraying both gollum and sm agol at the same time well imagine 7  or 8 characters i lost the count all in all james mcavoy sir congratulations you are superb anya taylorjoy is also incredible as casey her character has the most intriguing story of the three girls and shes the one who assumes the leadership of the group once the kidnap occurs her initially unknown past helps her through the traumatic situation but its really her rather captivating backstory that grabbed my attention its fundamental to the understanding of the ending and anya does a terrific job i also want to give a small praise to betty buckley for a beautiful and necessary interpretation of dr fletcher a character that offers the audience some knowledge of kevins disease as for the other two kidnapped girls well  theyre my main issue with the film since they dont have a good reason to be there claire haley lu richardson and marcia jessica sula arent the main characters and they dont have that much screen time but their dialogue still feels extremely forced and filled with a lot of nonsense the ending of the story might not be as twisty as in other shyamalans installments but i hope that people dont give up to false expectations the classic shyamalans twisty ending isnt a necessary attribute of his movies but the truth is that the twist is not the one you think it is once again the note at the end of my review will clarify this in the end split is shyamalans return to his old early 2000s self brilliantly unconventional storytelling a lot of suspense some very captivating subplots and a fantastic editing and production team behind him the soundtrack plays a huge role in this film as well as james mcavoy who delivers his careerbest performance anya taylorjoy is also pretty extraordinary something that cant be said about her fellow friends who portrayed two bland characters the ending brings the classic twist that makes everything more understandable and i gotta say  i love this film and it is one of 2017s best major spoiler below as i said above the soundtrack plays a huge role in the ending twist thats because the soundtrack that plays right before the title of the movie appears on the screen is the same one as in the third act of unbreakable this is one of the many clues throughout the film that hint at the idea that split belongs to unbreakables universe naturally after the title shows up theres a scene with david dunn bruce willis that confirms this theory but these are little details that make shyamalan into a great director and screenwriter also its a pity that ive only watched these movies after shyamalan stating that they were part of an eventual trilogy not that i was not surprised at the end of split but it did remove that first impact of pure shock in knowing that two films separated by 17 years in real life are part of the same universe both movies end up falling into the superhero genre unbreakable is the story of our hero who spent his whole life sad because he wasnt doing what he was supposed to do and split is an origin story of our villain if glass delivers this might be one of the best superhero trilogies ever ",

find tiresome and boring which is completely understandable its hard to deny that the screenplay is pretty much based on following mcdormand in an rv through the american west watching her meet new people working in a couple of different jobs and thats really it if people go into this movie expecting mindblowing developments and earthshaking revelations all will leave extremely disappointed its a slowpaced somewhat repetitive film told through zaos unique vision which is the key aspect that makes this movie work so well her astonishing dedication to delivering such a grounded depiction of a particular lifestyle elevates the overall piece technically i already addressed that the film is beautifully shot but ludovico einaudis score is tearinducing on its own with heartfelt piano tracks einaudis music plays during the most stunning landscapes helping those moments to induce the viewers to enter an introspectionlike state of mind zaos screenplay is packed with underlying themes but the diverse impactful views on what it means to live and how to deal with grief and personal traumas grabbed my attention the most despite all that i wrote above nomadland is highly performancedriven frances mcdormand carries this movie with yet another powerful display to add to her already impressive career her reactions in every single conversation that she has with the nonactors seem to come from mcdormand herself and not from her character fern speaking of her fern is an amazingly likable character the absolute definition of what it means to be a good person following such a protagonist makes the extremely long journey a bit lighter every nonactor is absolutely perfect i have nothing but overwhelming respect for them and the life they chose to live i dont expect the general public to love this film but id love to see the viewers trying to figure out what makes it so special many spectators will finish their viewing and think this is just another technical feature that only gets praises from critics i sincerely wish that viewers would ask themselves why they didnt enjoy a movie as much as other people and research about it learn about what makes the film so inspiring and such great storytelling yes its heavily philosophical its pacing could have been better controlled and it doesnt really have massive surprises or significant events but if it possesses a lot more than what its at the surface then investigate read a little bit about what went into creating this movie and maybe  just maybe  it will become a more enjoyable watch nomadland offers a contemplative enlightening touching story about a nomads life starring reallife people that make this film much more special chlo zaos unique passionate vision and her outstanding dedication to authenticity are more than enough characteristics deserving of dozens of nominations gorgeous cinematography and a lovely score tremendously elevate the movie creating the perfect atmosphere for thoughtful storytelling some pacing issues and an uneventful narrative based heavily on merely accompanying the protagonist through her journey negatively affect the films overall enjoyment which will definitely leave some viewers disappointed frances mcdormand carries the movie on her shoulders with another commanding performance to add to her remarkable career however the spotlight goes to the reallife nomads who participated in this beautiful project sharing personal stories filled with valuable perspectives on so many themes related to life and ways of living it a worthy contender for the awards season  ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog  as a fair and impartial film critic i need to state this i dont care about the controversy surrounding brie larson or the agendas this movie is trying to push or not im not part of any hate group or factions that hate those hate groups i just want to watch a good superhero origin film that introduces me to a new character that im supposed to care about and root for read my review sure but make up your own mind go see the movie and be honest since thats out of the way lets keep going  it was always going to be a huge risk trying to introduce such an important and powerful character like carol danvers into the end of phase three not only she comes from nowhere as far as i remember she was barely mentioned in previous films or even not mentioned at all before infinity war  but its the last movie before the climactic eraending avengers endgame she is the one who is going to take our heroes to victory against thanos the bad guy who i dare say easily defeated on his own pretty much every superhero we knew until that moment so while i was not expecting an outstanding story packed with phenomenal action i was also hoping for more than just a simple origin film like it came from phase one unfortunately thats exactly what i got everything is fine just okay theres no exceptional fight scene but most of it is decent theres no visual wonder but it doesnt look bad the characters potential feels wasted but they work for the plot everything is frustratingly balanced which is something i would praise in a bunch of other movies but this isnt 2008 anymore marvel isnt starting its cinematic universe it is almost finishing a whole arc involving more than 20 installments im going straight to the one character everyone wants to talk about goose  sorry captain marvel jokes aside this is one of the issues i was worried about going into the film theater i escaped 99 of the marketing for this movie as i do with every other flick i didnt watch a single clip trailer i know as much about the controversy surrounding this installment as my dog and i kept my expectations realistic having in mind what i truly know about the film and only the film itself the one thing i was not able to hide from were the headlines giving tremendous praise to  a cat now follow me on this im going to watch a superhero origin movie a whole new character is waiting for me at the big screen im excited to know more about her where does she come from what her powers are and so much more some headlines show up on my social media feed and i find that a cat steals the show deserves a spinoff and i dont even know what more granted the cat is indeed funny it provides some chuckles here and there thats it i love cats but i honestly cant figure out why everyone is so amazed by an animal doing animal things maybe its because the rest of the film isnt that entertaining  or perhaps just because people really really love cats like the movie itself i think its a mixture of both options back to what matters and to who everyone should be talking about brie larson marvel rarely misses its casting choices and being larson an academyaward winner her talent is undeniable she has everything she needs to consistently deliver a strong performance so im surprised that she couldnt stand out from the films overall blandness i repeat the movie isnt bad at all however i was expecting an actress of brie larsons caliber to elevate at least her own character but shes like everyone else just good enough i dont know if her performance was limited by bad direction or by her own decisions but the potential is there and im sure the russo brothers will give her a much more thrilling arc in endgame the two best attributes of the entire film are without a single doubt the buddycop relationship that carol and nick fury samuel l jackson develop and the groundbreaking deaging cgi storywise the interactions between these two characters are so captivating and humorous that the pacing issues of the first act gradually start to disappear carols past is often approached with quick flashes and a lot of cheap exposition so its a breath of fresh air to have slj and larson play off of each other nevertheless the deaging technology used is absolutely astounding my fellow readers welcome to the future of filmmaking where any actor actress can portray a younger version of themselves and not be visually disturbing i completely forgot slj is 70yearsold the best visual effects cgi are the ones you dont even know theyre there and captain marvel succeeds in delivering mindblowing realistic younger versions of wellknown actors characterwise anna boden and ryan fleck should have done way better so much wasted potential in such a crucial moment in the mcu carol danvers has a great backstory but the way it was explored kind of diminishes its impact still as captain marvel she is indeed a badass woman there are some cool action sequences especially in the beginning but as the movie slowly progresses on its story the fight scenes got more sloppy choppy and way too dark jude law yonrogg is amazing as he always is and ben mendelsohn is brilliant as talos both characters have interesting subplots that come together well which is not something that can be said for the rest of the marvel villains technically  you guessed it its okay taking away the jawdropping deaging cgi the visuals seem to lack some sort of style looking back at black panther captain america or guardians of the galaxy each movie has a visual aesthetic that belongs to their own stories captain marvel doesnt really feel like it has its own style i truly feel that with other directors this film could have been way better boden and fleck already proved that they are capable filmmakers but maybe they were not ready to lead such a massive blockbuster that said the 90s score is awesome and quite adequate to the movies period there are a couple of moments where the vfx regarding carol danverss powers are spectacular but everything ultimately feels like this is a phase one film instead of the 21st mcu installment all in all captain marvel achieves the minimum requirements introduce the fans to a new superhero who is going to be extremely important in the eventual defeat of thanos carol danvers is a fascinating character with an emotional backstory but the screenplay isnt structured or explored in the most entertaining way possible brie larson delivers a strong performance pushing aside her haters even if i feel that under other directors she would have reached her characters full potential her scenes with samuel l jackson are hilarious and the best part of the whole movie as well as the groundbreaking deaging cgi which is absolutely mindblowing the action sequences needed better editing and some more choreography this is mcus phase three and 2019 so i want to be able to actually see whats happening  but the most prominent issue is how the story blindly obeys the superhero origin films formula this isnt exactly a flaw or a problem its just that i was expecting more a lot more in the end theres not a memorable fight scene an emotionally overwhelming moment or even a genuinely bonechilling epic scene it doesnt leave you salivating for avengers endgame but it also doesnt leave you less excited everything is just  fine and theres nothing wrong with that but theres also nothing extraordinary ",

of every film ive ever seen however if i had to write this special list i have no doubts that se7en would be there obviously this is a rewatch of the classic movie that impacted filmmaking and launched david finchers remarkable career i also ignore the fact that alien 3 is connected to fincher due to the known production issues  with his next film mank coming up on netflix in a few weeks i decided to go through part of his filmography se7en will be the first out of five finchers movies that i will be able to revisit throughout this week ive seen this film countless times but to be completely honest i havent seen it in so long that i didnt remember exactly some important plot points and a key component about the ending this helped me experience se7en in a fascinating way once again andrew kevin walkers screenplay has one of the most intriguing mysterious captivating narratives ive ever witnessed still to this day from the very beginning to the last second im constantly at the edge of my seat in this case my couch with severe anxiety levels and feeling incredibly tense biting my nails moving my leg up and down changing positions its so mesmerizing that im only writing about it more than twentyfour hours after i watched it one of the most impressive aspects is how fincher is able to leave the viewer uncomfortable with showing only a single death onscreen this is an extremely dark gory bloodsoaked gruesome flick packed with horrible displays of dead bodies but never the actual murder scene with just a simple photo or a straight line of dialogue fincher lets the viewers imagination do the work and its undoubtedly as or more effective than a visually horrific killing sequence as the premise implies the serial killer is inspired by the seven deadly sins and he goes after the respective sinners killing them or letting them kill themselves in an innovative fashion turning the sin against the sinner the gluttony and sloth cases are visually brutal but the lust murder is the one that keeps haunting my memory the latter is also the less explicit left to openminded people to imagine the despicable act in 1995 a movie with such a dismal environment and dark story couldnt be wellreceived and se7en got its fair share of negative reviews stating that it was too obscure sinister overly violent and that the ending was absolutely unacceptable over time it found its success it gained fans all around the world and its now considered by many as one of the greatest films ever made myself included from the outstanding cast to the astonishingly enthralling detective work the third act stands out as one of the most shocking endings of alltime im keeping this review spoilerfree because i dont want readers who have not seen this movie to have such a magnificent piece of cinema ruined for them thats why im also hiding a certain actor from the starring section just like the marketing team did at the original date of release ill get there  finchers third act is simply flawless everything displayed onscreen in the last twenty minutes is filmmaking perfection from the impressively suspenseful buildup to that jawdropping climactic moment passing through a mindblowing revelation se7ens conclusion is and will remain as one of the most brutally shocking endings in the history of cinema morgan freeman and brad pitt share fantastic chemistry portraying two iconic characters that couldnt be more different than one another somerset is a notable detective with extreme attention to detail knowledgeable and always curious about the case at hand freeman incorporates this character effortlessly delivering a subtle yet powerful performance pitt portrays mills a childish unfocused immature replacement to the previous detective about to retire despite its apparent lack of work ethics mills is clever relentless in finding the killer and desperately wants to prove himself pitt just like freeman embodies this persona seamlessly and also gives an outstanding interpretation technically where should i begin from the haunting score of howard shore to the documentarylike cinematography darius khondji that offers a tremendously realistic atmosphere its the phenomenal production design that stands out fincher really wanted the dirty rainy depressing city to feel authentic and as real as possible the first dialogues of the film are meant to point out the bleakness and awfulness of the city but even without these conversations any viewer will be able to acknowledge the absence of color joyfulness and life in this unknown location finchers filmmaking techniques are demonstrated in plain splendor for everyone to see and this was just his beginning movies like se7en are impossible to be made today period it would never be conceivable to completely hide one of the main actors from the press tour and or trailers we live in a time where the promotion of a film must have everything and everyone nowadays trailers show way too much and this isnt news to anyone the ending was forced by pitt and fincher since the studio wanted a more mainstream conclusion today filmmakers may have more freedom but there are still countless cases of executive producers changing a movie without the directors will and or permission se7en was a film released in a time where it should have never been released in the first place fortunately it was se7en might be the best directors sophomore movie in the history of cinema and its undoubtedly one of my favorite films of alltime david finchers classic possesses one of the most captivating screenplays ive ever witnessed marked by an extremely dark somber violent gruesome story that ends with one of the most emotionally shocking conclusions to a movie ever the lack of onscreen death scenes is both the most surprising and effectively powerful element of the whole film leaving the unpleasant work of imagining a specific type of murder to the viewers mind morgan freeman and brad pitt are extraordinary as the now iconic detectives delivering two truly brilliant performances finchers trademark filmmaking style started here as every technical aspect contributes to the movies incredible realism from the simple documentarylike camera work to the ominous score its the authentic production design that sets the depressing tone the bleak atmosphere and the rainy colorless lifeless city overall its a technically flawless piece of art one of the greatest films ever made  i cant recommend it more  ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog  what a wonderful surprise i didnt watch any trailers or clips i completely stayed away from any sort of marketing but i couldnt hide from the negative feedback that social media was presenting people online were skeptical of how good will smiths genie would be of how mena massoud aladdin and naomi scott jasmine were not the best casting choices and of how the remake would actually honor and respect its original from someone who didnt know what to expect i thoroughly enjoyed guy ritchies take on the retelling of this famous story all of the fears described above are obliterated by a magical cast and theyre the ones who carry the movie to safe harbor ill start with one out of two standout performances will smith as the genie he delivers an indisputably unique and entertaining display as the blue entity by the way he moves and talks theres absolutely no way of people criticizing him for trying to copy robin williams smith does his own thing and it works superbly the best compliment i can give him is that i felt the same thing about genie in this remake that i did while watching the original every time he wasnt on screen i wanted him to be back immediately in the original i thought that the genie appeared in the right moments every single time which was when the pacing started to drop too much in this remake the periods without genie are more extended and the first act suffers a bit from its slow pace and lack of truly fun sequences nevertheless once the cave of wonders comes into play its a blast until the very end the magic carpet and abu make one hell of a comedy duo and theyre responsible for a lot of the laughs throughout the runtime going back to genie i love that ritchie and john august gave him something more in comparison with the original and thats one of few improvements actually made to the original i wrote on that review that i was hoping that they gave more time for the core relationship of the film to develop and that jafar marwan kenzari was more than just a paperthin villain well jafar keeps being an evil sorcerer that only desires power to rule everything and everyone unfortunately he has more screentime than its predecessor which means more overthetop monologues of kenzari and sillier sequences with the whole hypnosis trick on the other hand jasmine and aladdin have a fullydeveloped script which is by far the best improvement on the original their relationship grows naturally and each character gets a lot of moments to express their feelings and show who they truly are especially jasmine she is directly connected to an issue that will definitely make this movie incredibly divisive audience and critics alike but ill address it more at the end of the review independently of the characters mena massoud and naomi scott deliver breakthrough performances massoud is funny and quite likable as aladdin but naomi is an absolute standout now we look at this film as just another disney remake in a few years well look at aladdin 2019 as the movie that launched naomi scott into the stardom she is astonishingly outstanding as jasmine not only her voice is pretty amazing but her acting is unbelievably seamless regarding singing will smith and mena massoud are also pretty good and the musical numbers are another aspect that i surprisingly loved prince ali friend like me a whole new world and the new song speechless are beautiful powerful and the first twos production design and vfx are overwhelming in a good way guy ritchie is known for his very fluid chasing sequences and aladdin running through agrabah is very well filmed as expected however the long choreographed takes during these musical scenes are a wonder to behold from the first to the very last one even after the the end tagline shows up a perfect remake is one that is able to keep the originals essence while being its own thing ritchie does an impressive job balancing these pillars for anyone who loves the original and wanted the remake to be a shotbyshot retell of the story every single little detail from key words to important character moments is present in this film for anyone who wanted a different take theres more than enough minor changes to either how the story proceeds order of events more character development or even how it ends which leads me to the abovementioned divisive issue every time a political or social agenda is inserted in a movie people dont care if its wellwritten or not they just dont want any of those things on any film and i support that hollywood needs to stop trying to put something politically or socially correct in a movie just for the sake of it aladdin 2019 has a clear social message and it uses one of the main characters to state that message clearly now heres the catch having in mind the character in question how its written and what they do to send that social message i think its fine yes i know that a lot of people will think the complete opposite and crucify the film for it i usually do the following mental exercise does it make sense with the story character is it just a single moment during the movie proving that it might be too forced or do they develop the idea if it was an original film would i even be thinking about this yes they develop the idea probably not those are my answers and thats why i stand on the positive side of this soontobe heavily discussed subject during a few days people need to start opening their minds to these modern takes on pre21stcentury classics i always use dumbo 1941 as an example this is probably the most racist disney movie ever with extreme discrimination total disrespect for animals alcoholinduced plot points and so much more morally and socially wrong storylines and characters personalities theres no way that a film like that can be released today so obviously dumbo 2019 had to be extremely different from that onehour racism show aladdin 1992 also has a particular aspect about it that it doesnt quite fit nowadays culture its not offensive or anything but i bet that if it was released today a whole group of people would complain about it aladdin 2019 tries to adapt and while it might have tried too hard i still appreciate the effort and at least it makes sense its only a minor change to the core story and to the character in question so it shouldnt affect the overall viewing of the movie if speechless wasnt created it would have been totally fine but i have to admit that even if the song sounds great and the lyrics are impactful its still a stretch naomi scott interprets it beautifully though visually the film is stunning agrabah is an absolute delight that will make hardcore fans jaws drop continuously each time a new location is shown i love how ritchie strolls the camera around to showoff his production crew beautiful work most of the times through long and fluid takes i wish no pun intended he could have controlled the movies pace and tone better periods without genie to entertain the audience are too long and ritchie shouldnt risk the boredom levels to be as high as they are occasionally all in all aladdin 2019 succeeds in balancing the two pillars of any remake it keeps the originals true essence while standing on its own will smith shuts down online skeptics with a super entertaining and unique performance as genie but its naomi scott and mena massoud palpable chemistry that surprised the hell out of me the latter is perfect as aladdin but naomi has her breakthrough display which is definitely going to take her to even bigger stages guy ritchie proves hes a fantastic director by delivering some beautiful onetake sequences and exceptionally fun and wellchoreographed musical numbers technically the production and set design are astounding but the pacingtone levels arent as balanced as they should have been which makes the runtime overextend itself storywise people will feel incredibly divisive most of the screenplay is identical to its predecessor but disneys attempt to force down a social message is not going to help the film at all even if it makes sense and its only a minor twist it was still unnecessary and it might even shadow naomis brilliant performance which would be a massive shame jafar bothers me a lot more than any of this stuff however ritchie and john august deserve nothing but compliments for trying so hard to adapt such a risky original and mostly succeed doing it i genuinely hope it crushes in the box office its really a diamond in the rough  go watch it and make your own opinion  ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog before jumping into the movie itself i need to offer my appreciation for sofia coppolas career so far with such a renowned filmmaker as a father francis ford coppola the famous director behind the classic the godfather trilogy apocalypse now and much more  sofia was able to create a distinct career avoiding condescending comparisons with her fathers success most people in her situation would crumble to the pressure and succumb to a total failure fortunately sofia started showing her own unique talent early by delivering one of the best romcoms of the 2000s lost in translation only her second feature film  therefore i was actually pretty interested in the simple premise of on the rocks this latest installment in sofias filmography continues one of her trademark characteristics a light movie that addresses notthatlight themes the main narrative follows the answer to a binary question is lauras rashida jones husband dean marlon wayans  having an affair the two possible outcomes dont allow the film to carry any impactful surprises regarding this storyline but sofia writes a screenplay filled with astonishingly captivating character interactions mostly between laura and her father felix bill murray  the movies beginning focuses on demonstrating lauras daytoday basis developing this character in an exceptionally smooth manner these first minutes without felix in the picture establish lauras mental state perfectly her feelings thoughts doubts everything is shared with the viewer either through clean exposition or subtle expressions from the remarkable rashida jones who delivers a nuanced extremely rich performance then enter the phenomenal bill murray felix is a charming yet complicated old man who cant be around a woman without hitting on her or stating dumb things like i think im getting deaf to womens voices his relationship with her daughter seems quite close to the point of laura trusting his crazy conspiracy theories based on exaggerated facts here lies my number one issue with the film until the third act i could describe on the rocks in one word real every scene conversation or action is displayed in such a realistic way that i struggle to find a single sequence that didnt need to be in the movie at the end of each scene the viewer always learns something new whether about a character an event or merely a detail of someones life however the last halfanhour takes the main characters father and daughter to be clear through a path that crosses the line of common sense and makes me doubt if laura would truly do such a thing based on what the film showed of her personality until then nevertheless thats not the problem the real issue is the revelation that comes with this final act that raises a few questions concerning the fatherdaughter connection i cant get into spoilers but sofia develops felix as a fun entertaining nottobetakenseriously old guy who makes a few too many jokes that maybe he shouldnt however after discovering a certain part of his life and how it affected his family i partially lost empathy the revelation is probably the only slightly surprising aspect of the movie not because its shocking the film clearly points in that direction  but due to the viewers focus being on finding out if dean is cheating on laura this new development makes me question how laura can be so close to her father without ever showing onscreen how she dealt with this situation especially at the very end where the subject matter is brought back into her life dont be mistaken by this extensive explanation i still enjoyed the movie i cant deny the impact of this negative issue but its far from destroying the film its beautifully produced with every technical aspect complementing each other sofia controls both the pacing and the tone of the movie in a flawless fashion still rashida jones and bill murray steal the spotlight both deliver outstanding performances carrying the dialogues effortlessly and fully embracing their characters personas marlon wayans is also pretty good even though he doesnt have that much screentime with a short runtime the premise gets surprisingly more captivating than what i thought it was going to be i felt significantly invested in the process of finding out the answer to the big question and despite the partially disappointing third act this storyline is brilliantly executed in the end on the rocks is yet another success for a24 and apple tv  sofia coppola continues her already remarkable distinct career with another film defined by one of her trademark attributes a serious subject depicted through a lighter perspective possessing fascinating character interactions and a premise that ends up being a lot more engaging yet still somewhat predictable and formulaic than whats expected from it rashida jones and bill murray are genuinely impressive sharing palpable chemistry ultimately carrying the whole narrative on their shoulders it doesnt feel like a movie it feels like a real story with real people at least until the third act where an overthetop hardtoaccept sequence leads to a revelation that questions the fatherdaughter bond as well as the rushed resolution of such declaration i still recommend it as a weekends evening pick due to its short runtime and overall enjoyable story ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog its not easy to start off a new cinematic universe the first installment must be an undeniable success on almost all fronts for the franchise to take off from interesting worldbuilding to delivering a good first film its a brutally challenging task for any director and writer to take on godzilla has been around forever but warner bros and legendary entertainment bravely brought on an inexperienced filmmaker gareth edwards monsters  and a debutant screenwriter max borenstein to handle yet another version of the godzilla story expectationswise i know that audiences look at this type of movie from an actionheavy perspective a massive majority of the viewers just want to see monsters fighting which is understandable i enjoy a big battle as much as any other moviegoer but i do desire a remotely decent story when it comes to this particular genre i dont ask for an oscarworthy screenplay that leaves me floored by the end of the film i dont need incredibly complex multilayered characters with exquisite motivations i dont even mind heavy exposition as long as its not overdone and sluggish with that said i also dont want the most annoying cliche archetypes nor nonsensical plot points i genuinely hate myself when i get too nitpicky with movie logic issues but when the characters make the most ridiculously absurd decisions that no sane human being would make then the film is really asking for a negative commentary borenstein  who goes on to cowrite two of the following three installments in the monsterverse  gets close to a perfectly balanced narrative which in this genre is related to the amount of screentime allocated to humans and monsters this movie cant just be godzilla fighting a random monster since the visually appealing constant battles would lose impact with time besides the lack of a story  but it also cant waste all of its duration with the human characters  after all the film is titled godzilla not the brody family audiences all over the world enter their respective theaters to be blown away by the action visuals score and be thoroughly entertained by titans punching each other to death several characters carry surprisingly compelling arcs especially ford and joe brody the fatherson relationship between aaron taylorjohnson kickass and bryan cranston breaking bad argo feels authentic with both having a common unsolved problem from their past that links to the king of the monsters the emotional attachment to this family elevates the dangerous sequences that the movie holds throughout its runtime cranston offers an undeniable commitment to his role while taylorjohnson demonstrates some of the talent that would later be discovered by marvel ken watanabe inception batman begins is a fantastic addition to the cast as dr ishiro serizawa a scientist who fortunately doesnt follow the formulaic development usually thrown at this type of character elizabeth olsen oldboy martha marcy may marlene and sally hawkins blue jasmine happygolucky also get a bit of screentime but theyre basically just people close to the important characters gareth edwards admittedly loves the godzilla lore but any viewer can tell the great care that both edwards and borenstein have with their characters more screentime is handed to humanity than to the monsters which will undoubtedly disappoint many fans while i do feel invested in the protagonists too much time is spent with the military where countless exposition scenes drag the overall narrative the suspenseful buildup to the climactic third act is efficient but the action is frustratingly hidden from the viewers most of the titanic battles are seen through the windows of a car train building or even tvs the main problem with the film isnt spending time with humans when the monsters arent fighting but choosing to remain with these characters even when godzilla and co enter the scene titans are fighting right behind the camera and they keep the audience either entirely in the dark or just partially show a section of the battle most of the shots are groundlevel usually showing the pov of a certain character while that brings a higher sense of danger and desperation to the screen it also generates a frustrating feeling in the audience whos not seeing godzilla fighting in its full splendor i understand that part of this decision might be related to some less polished vfx and in all honesty despite the rare wide shots of the monsters the action is definitely entertaining and quite riveting alexandre desplats score is vibrant and the actual monsters look gorgeous in the purposefully dark environment helps to hide visual imperfections  especially godzilla godzilla focuses more on the human characters than on the monster fights and despite the narrative balance needing some adjustments it surprisingly works quite well as the first installment in the monsterverse gareth edwards and max borenstein deliver an incredibly compelling story on the human side fully developing the main characters and handing them interesting arcs most of the runtime is spent with these protagonists which will undoubtedly disappoint some fans who crave the titanic battles but the suspenseful buildup works in favor of the climactic third act however choosing to remain with the humans when the monsters are already fighting in the background is a questionable decision that leaves an extremely frustrating feeling in the audience cast visuals and score seem to hit the right notes but the actual combat is rarely seen in its full glory  most of it is shown through a groundlevel characters perspective  partially due to the necessity of hiding some vfx imperfections still its an utterly enjoyable monster flick that sets up a pretty entertaining cinematic universe  ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog when it comes to deciding if a certain film is added to my watchlist or not i consider various factors from genre and synopsis to cast directors and screenwriters sometimes just a familiar name can convince me to give that movie a go producers and or executives are far from being remotely influential in this type of decision however phil lord and christopher miller have directed written produced some of my favorite animated films of the last decade the lego movies spiderman into the spiderverse  so obviously i needed to watch the mitchells vs the machines previously known as connected mike rianda has his debut as a director screenwriter and voice actor aaron mitchell son  accompanied by jeff rowe the other writer 2021 is shaping up to be a phenomenal year it truly is i absolutely loved soul and wolfwalkers but if this sony pictures animation flick came out last year i genuinely dont know which one would i put higher on my top10 rianda and rowe deliver a brilliantly original screenplay packed with incredibly relatable characters and beautifully handled themes i cant quite remember the last time i laughed out loud when watching an animated feature by myself every joke about technology is hilariously clever making fun of ridiculous yet realistic human behaviors regarding malfunctions low speed and even lack of wifi i cried of laughter but i was also close to dropping a couple of tears due to the main narrative ill start with the protagonist katie mitchell as a young aspiring filmmaker abbi jacobsons character follows a wellknown arc about not having friends being the socalled weirdo and having parents  in this case more her father  who simply dont understand who she is what she likes or why she loves something they simply dont understand while its true that this storyline isnt exactly new it doesnt mean its not captivating and emotionally powerful when written and developed properly rianda and rowe make katie an extremely relatable character in such a seamless manner that its harder to not connect with her than the contrary anyone has at least once in their lifetime felt left out or alone obviously since i share the exact same passion as katie its easier for me to feel precisely the same as her once she discovers new friends with whom she can talk about the art she loves the most i still have no circle of friends who i can meet daily to discuss the latest movie news or newly released films inperson  so katies journey does have a more significant impact on me than it might have on other viewers however it doesnt have to be about art or a specific subject in a general analysis katie just feels lonely and wants to follow her dreams but feels unsupported by her father rick mitchell danny mcbride  one of the most compelling aspects of the mitchells vs the machines is the fact that rick and katie share the same arc just going in different directions while katie feels like getting out of the house and going away forever is the best solution to all her problems rick believes that her staying with the family is the safest route one that features no failures that could hurt her emotionally  something that rick learned from his past hence the necessity of overprotecting her daughter at all costs since theyre on opposite sides of the spectrum constant fights lies and hurtful comments drive them apart leading to a wonderfully written story about family love friendship and understanding the other side of the argument katies mother linda mitchell maya rudolph  and brother aaron mitchell rianda  serve more as triggers to heartfelt conversations with the two main characters but they also have their own personal journey while linda feels jealous of her instagramperfect neighbors and embarrassed of showing off her own family photos aaron deals with his bizarre love for dinosaurs in a lighter funnier way than katies dramatic arc both storylines carry their own lovely messages to transmit to the audience but katie and ricks confrontational relationship embodies sensitive issues that tons of families across the globe never find a solution for another remarkable characteristic of this screenplay is how rianda and rowe never take a definite stance on any topic they always try to follow one of the movies main messages and present good points for both sides of the conflict for example the mitchells vs the machines could easily be misinterpreted as an attack on the internet and technology in general but every dialogue is exceptionally balanced while comments are made about using our phone at the dinner table or during family moments as well as excessive screentime and overreliance on social media new technology can give birth to the most inspirational motivational and influential works of art without it katies dreams would be totally different transitioning to the more technical elements of the film its impossible not to tackle the new animation style into the spiderverse was an experimental movie and its success might have changed the future of animation forever the mix of a more illustrative handpainted approach with another focused on the cgi realism seen in most films today offers  just like the movie itself  a seamless balance between the two supposedly opposing styles this blend allows keeping the expressiveness and extreme level of detail of the classic method while also maintaining the realistic environment of the 3d cgi design the action sequences are extraordinarily energetic riveting and quite impressive to say the least the films soundtrack score by mark mothersbaugh is onpoint elevating dozens of scenes with excellent music choices that most viewers didnt even remember already exquisite editing greg levitan and outstanding voice work across the board i genuinely cant find a single issue with this movie and id be extremely surprised  and disappointed  if it doesnt end up being a frontrunner for next years awards season both kids and adults will have tremendous fun with this fastpaced highly entertaining film while also getting a few valuable life lessons along the way and who knows maybe this movie will inspire families to make that road trip theyve been planning for ages the mitchells vs the machines might not have the catchiest title but its definitely one of the best animated feature films of the last years with a beautiful blend of two animation styles  that may impact the future of this type of movie  mike rianda and jeff rowe deliver an emotionally resonant story about family love and more explicitly placing ourselves in someone elses shoes featuring incredibly relatable characters the remarkably written screenplay strikes a perfect balance in every topic it approaches by presenting arguments for both sides without ever defining something as right or wrong the character arcs might be wellknown storylines but the exceptional writing elevates every personal journey especially katie and ricks daughter and father boasting great voice work from everyone involved the fastpaced narrative still holds impressive colorful screenpopping action sequences filled with energy excitement and fantastic song choices its one of those uncommon films where i cant find a single flaw with it a mustwatch hilarious film for both kids and adults ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog  1941s dumbo was never a favorite of mine its a great movie with a sweet message as most disney flicks  but i was curious to see how a remake of a 60min film would develop obviously changes to the story not only will occur but they need to people have to stop desiring these liveaction remakes to be a literal copypaste of their originals and start being fair to these movies pure animation is different from liveaction and the latter provides a much more realistic environment than the former so its evident that every remake they produce will have some updates in the more silly aspects furthermore ive witnessed a couple of critics hating this dumbo hating calling it one of the worst films of the year now thats a strong feeling to have against a movie that improves so much regarding its original yes it has a bunch of narrative issues and the dialogues can be cringeworthy but hating this 2019 remake while defending the original as it was some kind of masterpiece is ridiculous complaining about the 2019s ending when the 1941s is absolutely inadmissible is being a hypocrite whining about dumbo not being 100 the star of the show when the original has the elephant discover his flight abilities four minutes before the end is dumb in addition to that this film runs for twice the originals runtime what did you expect that human characters wouldnt be a necessary modification some critics are even complaining about animal abuse or their unnecessary exploration are they joking have they seen the original do they remember how racist it was how discrimination was treated as comedy even alcohol was handled as a plot point for gods sake 2019s dumbo barely has any animal violence and its final message is against animal captivity or exploration so any person who criticizes this ending is either a despicable human being or not a fan of the original dumbo at all enough about those critics i feel sick just remembering what they wrote said unfortunately 2019s dumbo does have a lot of screenplay issues theres no way of denying it the human characters are filled with cliche storylines and childwritten dialogues i know that analyzing childrens acting is not exactly a fair critic but ive seen so many remarkable young actors nowadays who make nico parker and finley hobbins performances look not that good their scripts also dont help  the visual style characteristic of tim burton is definitely present even if its magic becomes overwhelming at times 1941s dumbo was very concentrated in one small location contrary to its 2019 remake where v a vandeveres park feels like disneyland the stiff dialogues dont help the movies pacing and its tone could be better balanced nevertheless just the opportunity to watch such a gorgeous magnificent and visually jawdropping liveaction elephant come to life is absolutely delightful and entertaining as hell when a character like dumbo makes you cry when hes crying makes you feel sad when hes feeling sad makes you happy when hes feeling happy thats when you know the visual effects team has reached a point where liveaction is pretty much reality the little elephant looks like an adorable little elephant i mean what better compliment can i give a liveaction character than it looks and feels real even with the issues mentioned above its still a heartfelt story filled with emotional moments and a wonderful message technically it might lack consistency and some overall quality but i end up enjoying myself experiencing dumbos pain happiness and his bond with the kids flourish is special colin farrell and eva green deliver good performances and their character arcs cliche as they may be still carry some efficiency theres a wrong vibe surrounding the word cliche like its a bad thing not at all something being cliche just means weve seen that before a lot of times it doesnt mean weve seen it performed better or worse dumbo is a remake of a very influential 1941 film so obviously cliches are a certainty its a disney tale after all in the end cliche as it might be 2019s dumbo improves on a lot of aspects of its predecessor i do believe these movies are almost incomparable since the dimension runtime and even the main plot are surprisingly or not different still not remembering or even acknowledging the original not only is an absolute flaw but it can ultimately make you a hypocrite so be careful with what you write say i understand a person not enjoying this film or not liking it as much as i did but if you hate  it you better give me good enough reasons dumbo is probably the most visually stunning and incredibly realistic liveaction character disney was able to produce so far this little elephant alone is worth the price of admission his arc is way bigger and complex than the one in the original which can either delight or disappoint you to me it not only worked but it finished strong and way better than the original its upsetting that the screenplay couldnt accompany burtons impressive visual style even if overwhelming at times as well as the human characters who feel a bit detached from the actual story to tell its still a good time at the movie theater so go see it ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog aaron sorkin has been around for quite some time a few good men moneyball steve jobs and arguably one of the best movies of the last decade the social network all have one thing in common sorkin as a screenwriter but not as the director mollys game was sorkins directorial debut which makes the trial of the chicago 7 only his second time in the directors chair ive either loved or liked every film from him so obviously my expectations were already high enough solely due to his presence however with the announcement of such a stellar cast its impossible not to expect one of the best movies of the year to come out of this project expectations fulfilled this is in fact one of 2020s very best films without the shadow of a doubt based on real events the movie quickly jumps to the main point of action the trial only twenty minutes in the viewer is already inside the famous courtroom where the expected and the unexpected occur simultaneously sorkins employs a narrative structure that keeps me captivated until the final credits start to roll the actions that led to this court case are demonstrated throughout the same instead of being shown through a linear timeline which would reduce the trials value its the main reason why such a simple premise turns into a phenomenal adaptation of the historical event i couldnt take my eyes offscreen for a single second or lose one of the many incredible dialogues every conversation every argument every objection overrule or motion denied is transmitted to the viewer in an exceptionally captivating manner its one of those movies where the action belongs to words instead of fists i felt tremendously invested in the trial it never loses a gram of interest its fullon exciting all the time i desperately wanted to find out the result of the case i didnt possess knowledge of the real story but ill address this further down  i really wanted to witness the events that put the defendants in their respective positions i strongly desired to see the end of the situation as soon as the film ends i felt the urge to immediately research everything about the true story i spent close to fortyfive minutes reading many articles about the 1968 democratic national convention the riots the presidential nominees everything this is one of the most important criteria i have to define how successful a historical flick truly is how much does it compel me to research everything about it the trial of the chicago 7 convinces me to study the real events with significant impact from what ive read sorkin changes a few details timelinewise something pretty common in this type of movie  but overall its a pretty accurate realistic adaptation technically every component is remarkable as expected from a netflixsorkin partnership however the score plays a special part since its volume in crescendo elevates several escalating situations leaving me at the edge of my couch biting my nails its a fantastic achievement from daniel pemberton who also scored birds of prey and enola holmes this year additionally this might not be a onelocation film but sorkin keeps the camera so focused on the courtroom that it feels like the audience is stuck in there with the defendants besides sorkins screenplay the cast obviously plays a massive role just like i mentioned above this is a movie where the action is played out through words inside the courtroom there are constant arguments countless contempts of court a voir dire it doesnt hurt to google courtroom terminology before the film  and so much more that leads the judge to make questionable decisions based on shocking evidence every actor is absolutely outstanding i was able to feel everything during that trial but i do have four standouts sacha baron cohen abbie hoffman shares the laugh spotlight with jeremy strong jerry rubin  but he ends up being the ultimate comic relief his delivery and timing are pure gold i cant deny that i was surprised by his performance since ive only seen him in borat hes extremely funny but dont be mistaken by my words abbie proves to be one of the most essential defendants in the trial offering a memorable testimony and demonstrating his real purpose eddie redmayne brings his oscarwinner face to the game by interpreting tom hayden a vital character that lets the viewer know that while they might not all be completely guilty theyre not all exactly innocent as well haydens final speech is one of redmaynes best scenes of his career mark rylance plays the role of the public portraying the defendants lawyer william kunstler he shares the viewers frustration with the judges decisions but never gives up trying to bring justice to the case if i had to bet on an actor to get awards buzz by the end of the year it would be rylance due to his powerful display my last standout is frank langella as the judge julius hoffman i believe a lot of people will give credit to every actor for portraying characters they love but most will forget the actor that interprets the character everyone hates langella deserves all of the praise in the world for making me despise completely such an unfair racist unqualified judge his performance is simply extraordinary these are my four standouts but the entire cast is phenomenal im a bit disappointed that i didnt get to see more from yahya abdulmateen ii bobby seale  but after researching bobbys involvement in this story i understand his lack of relevance to the main narrative he plays more of a modern parallel to the 60s in the sense that the judge heavily discriminates against him during the trial transmitting a message that humanitys behavior may have evolved regarding racism but theres still a long way to go a final shoutout to joseph gordonlevitt who is also excellent as richard schultz i only have one issue in terms of entertainment the viewer entering the main stage after only twenty minutes is a bold yet efficient move however the introduction to the characters and the story itself goes by so fast that i could only understand whos who and their purpose during the trial sorkin assumes people know everything about who these characters are what they did and where the narrative is driving towards skipping through dozens of details that mostly nonamerican audiences will struggle to understand in time sorkin could have given these characters more depth initially offering the viewer time to get familiar with their names and organizations all in all the trial of the chicago 7 is undoubtedly one of the best movies of the year probably the best at the date of this review aaron sorkins narrative structure and the brilliant cast are the two main reasons why this film succeeds so well sorkins screenplay is organized in a way that keeps the viewer astonishingly captivated throughout the entire runtime by following a nonlinear structure maintaining the focus on a single location is an exceptional decision for a movie where words are the action of the story inside the courtroom is where every fascinating argument ensues never losing steam until the very end its also a lot funnier than i expected regarding the cast sacha baron cohen mark rylance eddie redmayne and frank langella are my standouts but every actor delivers outstanding performances daniel pembertons score shines in an overall very wellproduced film the first twenty minutes fly by in favor of entertainment by quickly placing the viewer inside the courtroom but its so rushed that it makes it difficult for the audience to remember everyones names and purposes assuming everyone knows the true story and the people involved is a risky move especially for nonamericans nevertheless this minor issue doesnt affect an otherwise flawless movie obviously i strongly recommend it maybe reading a bit about the real events beforehand will help the eventual viewing but dont read too much due to the usual spoilers ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog  first of all i didnt know anything about shazam what his powers were what story did he have basically i didnt know who he was this is what david f sandbergs movie does best introduce the audience to a new dc superhero by delivering an uncommonly wellstructured comicbook screenplay packed with laughter and entertaining action zachary levi is undoubtedly the standout not only is he hilarious but he perfectly captures the childlike personality that a kidturnedadult would have his expressions of absolute surprise and awe of his powers are extremely precious and he effortlessly carries the more lighthearted tone on his shoulders asher angel is brilliant as billy batson his character has a notably wellwritten and wellexplored backstory which eventually justifies the person he has become its the most emotional and heartfelt subplot of the film probably the only one really  and henry gayden did a fantastic job writing its script it doesnt feel cliche or overthetop it actually feels grounded and quite realistic jack dylan grazer plays his best friend freddy freeman and hes the primary source of selfaware comedy he knows all the cliches regarding superheroes and supervillains so his jokes constantly land and play seamlessly into the last act usually villains tend to be hollow characters with paperthin motivations but since a few years ago this issue has gradually been corrected the latest comicbook movies have incredibly welldeveloped villains who carry a compelling backstory that entirely supports their beliefs but not their actions this type of villains work because not only the audience can understand where they come from but in some cases they can even connect with and care about them dr thaddeus sivana is not exactly someone the audience ends up caring about but his backstory is emotionally powerful enough for us to understand where his motivations originate from mark strong delivers a menacing performance and his costume makeup looks pretty badass the first act is kind of a mixed bag it starts in a very captivating way and once you understand whos the character at the center it gets even better however the films tone takes long to establish itself and the beginning of the movie struggles to find which jokes land and which dont the humor is onpoint throughout the rest of the runtime but those first few jokes not so much which threw me off a little bit the action sequences are amazing and the sound design allows the audience to feel every punch kick a fall on the ground or a supermanish takeoff the fight sequences are seamlessly edited and you know how much i love wellchoreographed or welledited action scenes shazams search for his powers provides the funniest and most entertaining moments of the film each test that he puts himself through is both hilarious and informative this is another aspect of the screenplay i love so much they had several ideas of how to approach this segment and they nailed every single execution from the popculture references to the herovillain cliches sandberg did a terrific job exploring those concepts and he executed them flawlessly the best jokes are the ones that can be funny on different levels for different people if people can laugh at a particular scene solely due to it but other people can laugh even more because that moment means so much more to them thats when you know a joke is perfect shazam is not only funny for comicbook fans everyone can leave the theater entertained and jolly its still a straightforward superhero movie theres still a villain to defeat and the film goes through all of the cliches that it makes so much fun of everyone knows how its going to develop plot point by plot point a few minutes in not that i consider this a flaw its just it is what it is the final battle drags too much and it keeps ending and restarting every five minutes it does have a pretty cool conclusion but it takes a bit too long to get there also and i know that this is one of those logical nitpicks that cinemasins are known for digging but the flashbacks and timejumps could have received better treatment concerning the age of the characters one thing is to think that the characters would look much older younger than what they display onscreen but when they make them look exactly the same in the span of 30 40 years not so acceptable all in all shazam is a blast its the most entertaining movie ive seen so far this year and its freaking hilarious it continues the comicbook films trend to change how villains are written by delivering a welldeveloped bad guy menacingly portrayed by mark strong every member of the cast gives a strong performance but zachary levi steals the show his whimsical attitude reckless personality and rich facial expressions are guaranteed to entertain you for most of the runtime asher angel and jack dylan grazer are outstanding as the young kids and the formers backstory carries emotional impact which passes on to the big guy he transforms himself into the action is packed with beautifullyedited sequences powerful sound design and cool unique moments but the supposedly climactic final battle drags too much the first act struggles to find its rhythm and its tone but once it gets going its an exceptional journey the best praise i can give sandbergs movie is that i didnt know anything about shazam before entering the theater and now i cant wait for its sequel welldirected wellwritten and remarkably entertaining what more can i ask go see it  ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog finally i managed to watch one of my most anticipated movies of 2017 i am an authentic fanboy of the star wars saga and i loved its return two years ago when the force awakens was released everything looked better sounded better and the story certainly didnt disappoint me so obviously i was extremely looking forward to the last jedi apparently critics love episode viii but fans not so much me well  i dont love it but i do enjoy it very much i do think it is a bit below the previous films overall quality since it definitely has some issues the first one did not i am also confident that i know why the fans are not loving this movie and i will explain that after a few paragraphs this time i am going to start at the other side of the spectrum i will begin my review with the films problems because i do need to get them out of my mind especially this one  the subplot involving finn john boyega  rose kelly marie tran and dj benicio del toro  some of the few new characters added to the franchise completely ruins the movies pacing and its narrative is such a tremendous deviation from the main story it is by far the worst issue i have with the screenplay because it does not work as one single problem  it creates a whole other set of them the first acts pacing is really fast since it starts with tons of action sequences however the second act decreases the rhythm and it is more storydriven full of mysteryunlocking and characterdevelopment scenes finn and roses nonsense adventure just turns everything slower and even strange it ends up needlessly extending the runtime the film could have easily been 15min shorter and worse  possibly creating a love triangle with rey i am not even going to discuss this  apart from this major issue s  i have some minor problems general hux domhnall gleeson is a strong candidate to become the most annoying character in this newgeneration trilogy gleeson is fine he actually achieves a good overthetop performance but his character is just tumbling off the rails also on a more technical aspect the writing does not flow as well as it did on jj abrams screenplay there are a lot more exposition scenes which also does not help the pacing at all i wrote earlier about the fans reasons for them to be disappointed and well the marketing for the movie did not lie they do take a lot of chances with this one rian johnson delivers a lot of twists and shocks throughout the whole runtime and it is impossible to assume that every single one of them is going to be mindblowing and unanimously accepted i do not want to give anything away from the plot so i am just going to write that most of the choices and paths they choose for each character i either simply accept them or i truly love them as for the rest i am at most underwhelmed yet i trust and understand the decisions they went with  people need to learn how to deal with their own expectations if you expect something utterly absurd and nonsensical to occur and then it does not you cant blame the film for not following your crazy idea so please dont start blabbing any movie is bad or disappointing because it didnt fulfill your ridiculously high expectations even if they are grounded and thoughtful you have to embrace the productions approach to the character story if it makes sense then it is as valid as any other theory it might be underwhelming if you have high expectations but it is still a serious take on whatever you are thinking this is why i think fans are not loving the last jedi the production takes a lot of risks and some of them dont work with everyone mostly due to fans radical theories that dont have a place in the film i think most people might change their initial opinion after a second viewing myself included some things just need more time to process or even a whole rewatch since i do not have time to do it before the years end i am going with what i have switching to the light side hehe  i do enjoy this movie a lot every cast member that was great in episode vii transcends themselves in this one daisy ridley is superb as rey she has such a massive range of expressions and i am sure her successful future as an actress is surely guaranteed from the most emotional and somber moments to the most epic action scenes she is awesome her characters mysterious backstory reaches a whole new extent and her interactions with kylo ren adam driver and luke skywalker inflict chills all over my body mark hamills comeback cant be any more amazing than it is he delivers a fantastic emotionfull and very compelling performance it is even more unbelievable knowing that hamill had strong personal arguments against the directors interpretation of what was better for luke if he is this astounding working against his own idea of who his character really is then i must praise his exemplary working principles luke and rey spend a big chunk of the runtime training on an unknown island and i love every single second filmed on that piece of land i have to admit that i am a bit frustrated because i think the film should have more time with these two but due to the issues mentioned in the beginning of my review the runtime cant be much more stretched i love what they did with luke even if some fans are going to go insane with his journey adam driver as kylo ren  the undoubtful star of the whole show driver is becoming a menace to every actor working today because he is flawless he has a powerful dark mysterious compelling and commanding display as one of the most complex and multilayered characters of the star wars saga rens conflict inside his mind and heart is the most captivating feature of his story and his interactions with rey are so jawdropping spectacular that i cant even describe them properly john boyega is once again great as finn even though he is part of that horrible subplot boyega delivers a convincing performance and finn shines through some awesome action set pieces kelly marie tran is actually good as rose it is just a pity that her character suffers from the narrative even though her backstory is pretty touching chewbacca joonas suotamo and the porgs the new cute animals implemented in the star wars universe have all the funny scenes plus some action here and there oscar isaac is quite lucky because poe dameron unquestionably has the best subplot of the movie isaac offers a very passionate display as poe goes through some significant character development his impulsive instincts to attack the bad guys always have consequences and he is put in check by leia carrie fisher during the whole time it is a very interesting and twistful story that elevates the films main plot carrie fisher is elegant and beautiful as leia a character that has a lot more screentime than what i expected i always love seeing fisher on the screen and she makes everything a bit more realistic to me andy serkis is remarkable as supreme leader snoke but his character is yet another plots detail that fans are not going to appreciate so much i still feel underwhelmed by snoke in this movie for several reasons but after some thinking i do understand his role in the film and his moments are indeed intimidating and dominant rian johnson work as the director is better than him as the writer the visuals effects continue to be wonderful and the practical settings are beautiful once again there is a lot less cgi than you probably think excellent cinematography and the john williams score induces enormous levels of nostalgia and excitement the action sequences are mindblowing the stunt work is phenomenal and there are tons of pure epic and awesome scenes the main plot includes a very dark and mysterious side to it that i thoroughly love a lot of unexpected twists and turns make the last jedi more original than the force awakens even if one or two plot points might be underwhelming and it also has a very well balanced tone finally a thrilling breathtaking actionheavy third act ends the film with magnificent glory and with many heartfelt moments all in all star wars the last jedi delivers something that i can be proud of experiencing terrific performances from the cast but a flawlessly powerful display from adam driver as kylo ren steals the spotlight rian johnson takes a lot of risks with decisions that will make the fanbase debate for years and while i find most of them truly jawdropping a few left me underwhelmed the main story keeps its obscure mystery while packing some jawdropping epic action sequences and excellent characterdevelopment scenes nevertheless it departs from jjs visual storytelling delivering a more expositionheavy screenplay and some pacing issues bring the movie down largely due to the unnecessary detour of the subplot involving finn and rose in the end it still belongs to my top half of the saga fighting for the 4th spot with return of the jedi and rogue one  ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog even though the white tiger isnt exactly the first review i published in 2021 it was the first film i watched at the start of this new year i really didnt know what to expect ive never seen anything from any actor involved in the movie or from the writerdirector ramin bahrani i still follow the trailerfree philosophy that i established back in 2017 so my knowledge about the actual story was close to null nevertheless all of these details left me quite excited to be completely honest starting 2021 with a 100 blind watch something i sincerely appreciate is an excellent way of beginning a year that i hope will be better than the previous one it shouldnt be that hard  from the getgo its clear that bahrani will use his film in an enlightening educational manner to teach its viewers about indias sociopolitical stratification caste system and its economic consequences the viewer follows adarsh gouravs character balram whos trying to get away from the dated traditions and become a real entrepreneur i rarely love straightup political movies even when these follow the satire route on par with religion these are two matters that ive been avoiding talking about my whole life from corruption to wars there are literally hundreds of reasons that justify my detachment from these topics with that said the white tiger holds several significant messages concerning poor families low caste who must work hard in unimaginable conditions just to survive specifically in india it also approaches ideas such as arranged marriage and the unbreakable masterservant bond these cultural lessons on indias sociopolitical and socioeconomic structure are by far the most interesting aspect of the entire screenplay and bahrani does a fantastic job of conveying this awareness to the audience in a compelling manner with the help of paolo carnera dp  the story is filmed at groundlevel putting the viewers in the dirty smelly impoverished streets of different places across india generating a realistic atmosphere chad keiths production design is also vital to create that immersive indian environment despite the wonderful technical aspects bahranis script is packed with an overwhelming succession of narrative events that fail to further develop the protagonist or impact the story especially from the midpoint of the film onwards some sequences are similar to previous ones ultimately making the movie feel repetitive while not moving the plot forward unfortunately it really feels like the viewers could miss a couple of minutes here and there and not miss anything genuinely relevant therefore bahranis flick becomes overlong and slower than what it needs to be consequently affecting the viewers attention which might result in some of the critical messages getting lost in the transmission mainly the economic one balrams narration helps but bahrani could have found a better and more logical justification for this storytelling detail in addition to this its a film that depends on the viewers knowledge about india and their interest in learning more about it in my case the white tiger didnt surprise me with any information  which doesnt help the entertainment value  but its visuals helped me connect what i knew to something quite palpable i do want to end on a positive note though the unknown cast is phenomenal but the biggest praise must go to adarsh gouravs first lead role balram is a wellwritten character who will definitely connect with many viewers all around the world gourav shows quite a good range demonstrating his comedic timing and funny expressions but also an emotional side that truly elevated some of the best scenes in the entire movie the white tiger employs the english and indian languages to educate viewers about indias sociopolitical and socioeconomic system by following adarsh gouravs character who narrates the largest email ever about his life despite the somewhat silly setup ramin bahrani delivers an enlightening interesting narrative with dozens of relevant messages regarding indias culture and the incredibly challenging way of living of most of its population gourav offers a brilliant performance debut in a lead role  elevating a wellwritten relatable character who goes through an unbelievable life story surrounded by an immersive production design and terrific camera work creating a realistic environment unfortunately this netflixs flick is overwhelmed by an absurd amount of gradually unimpactful narrative events unnecessarily extending the runtime and hurting the overall pacing by becoming repetitive the viewers attention levels decrease leading to a scenario where some of the essential lessons get lost in their delivery overall i recommend it to viewers interested in learning more about india and people who actually lived or were born there but if your knowledge about the country is good enough it might not be as entertaining and informative as you would expect  ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog aaron sorkin has been around for quite some time a few good men moneyball steve jobs and arguably one of the best movies of the last decade the social network all have one thing in common sorkin as a screenwriter but not as the director mollys game was sorkins directorial debut which makes the trial of the chicago 7 only his second time in the directors chair ive either loved or liked every film from him so obviously my expectations were already high enough solely due to his presence however with the announcement of such a stellar cast its impossible not to expect one of the best movies of the year to come out of this project expectations fulfilled this is in fact one of 2020s very best films without the shadow of a doubt based on real events the movie quickly jumps to the main point of action the trial only twenty minutes in the viewer is already inside the famous courtroom where the expected and the unexpected occur simultaneously sorkins employs a narrative structure that keeps me captivated until the final credits start to roll the actions that led to this court case are demonstrated throughout the same instead of being shown through a linear timeline which would reduce the trials value its the main reason why such a simple premise turns into a phenomenal adaptation of the historical event i couldnt take my eyes offscreen for a single second or lose one of the many incredible dialogues every conversation every argument every objection overrule or motion denied is transmitted to the viewer in an exceptionally captivating manner its one of those movies where the action belongs to words instead of fists i felt tremendously invested in the trial it never loses a gram of interest its fullon exciting all the time i desperately wanted to find out the result of the case i didnt possess knowledge of the real story but ill address this further down  i really wanted to witness the events that put the defendants in their respective positions i strongly desired to see the end of the situation as soon as the film ends i felt the urge to immediately research everything about the true story i spent close to fortyfive minutes reading many articles about the 1968 democratic national convention the riots the presidential nominees everything this is one of the most important criteria i have to define how successful a historical flick truly is how much does it compel me to research everything about it the trial of the chicago 7 convinces me to study the real events with significant impact from what ive read sorkin changes a few details timelinewise something pretty common in this type of movie  but overall its a pretty accurate realistic adaptation technically every component is remarkable as expected from a netflixsorkin partnership however the score plays a special part since its volume in crescendo elevates several escalating situations leaving me at the edge of my couch biting my nails its a fantastic achievement from daniel pemberton who also scored birds of prey and enola holmes this year additionally this might not be a onelocation film but sorkin keeps the camera so focused on the courtroom that it feels like the audience is stuck in there with the defendants besides sorkins screenplay the cast obviously plays a massive role just like i mentioned above this is a movie where the action is played out through words inside the courtroom there are constant arguments countless contempts of court a voir dire it doesnt hurt to google courtroom terminology before the film  and so much more that leads the judge to make questionable decisions based on shocking evidence every actor is absolutely outstanding i was able to feel everything during that trial but i do have four standouts sacha baron cohen abbie hoffman shares the laugh spotlight with jeremy strong jerry rubin  but he ends up being the ultimate comic relief his delivery and timing are pure gold i cant deny that i was surprised by his performance since ive only seen him in borat hes extremely funny but dont be mistaken by my words abbie proves to be one of the most essential defendants in the trial offering a memorable testimony and demonstrating his real purpose eddie redmayne brings his oscarwinner face to the game by interpreting tom hayden a vital character that lets the viewer know that while they might not all be completely guilty theyre not all exactly innocent as well haydens final speech is one of redmaynes best scenes of his career mark rylance plays the role of the public portraying the defendants lawyer william kunstler he shares the viewers frustration with the judges decisions but never gives up trying to bring justice to the case if i had to bet on an actor to get awards buzz by the end of the year it would be rylance due to his powerful display my last standout is frank langella as the judge julius hoffman i believe a lot of people will give credit to every actor for portraying characters they love but most will forget the actor that interprets the character everyone hates langella deserves all of the praise in the world for making me despise completely such an unfair racist unqualified judge his performance is simply extraordinary these are my four standouts but the entire cast is phenomenal im a bit disappointed that i didnt get to see more from yahya abdulmateen ii bobby seale  but after researching bobbys involvement in this story i understand his lack of relevance to the main narrative he plays more of a modern parallel to the 60s in the sense that the judge heavily discriminates against him during the trial transmitting a message that humanitys behavior may have evolved regarding racism but theres still a long way to go a final shoutout to joseph gordonlevitt who is also excellent as richard schultz i only have one issue in terms of entertainment the viewer entering the main stage after only twenty minutes is a bold yet efficient move however the introduction to the characters and the story itself goes by so fast that i could only understand whos who and their purpose during the trial sorkin assumes people know everything about who these characters are what they did and where the narrative is driving towards skipping through dozens of details that mostly nonamerican audiences will struggle to understand in time sorkin could have given these characters more depth initially offering the viewer time to get familiar with their names and organizations all in all the trial of the chicago 7 is undoubtedly one of the best movies of the year probably the best at the date of this review aaron sorkins narrative structure and the brilliant cast are the two main reasons why this film succeeds so well sorkins screenplay is organized in a way that keeps the viewer astonishingly captivated throughout the entire runtime by following a nonlinear structure maintaining the focus on a single location is an exceptional decision for a movie where words are the action of the story inside the courtroom is where every fascinating argument ensues never losing steam until the very end its also a lot funnier than i expected regarding the cast sacha baron cohen mark rylance eddie redmayne and frank langella are my standouts but every actor delivers outstanding performances daniel pembertons score shines in an overall very wellproduced film the first twenty minutes fly by in favor of entertainment by quickly placing the viewer inside the courtroom but its so rushed that it makes it difficult for the audience to remember everyones names and purposes assuming everyone knows the true story and the people involved is a risky move especially for nonamericans nevertheless this minor issue doesnt affect an otherwise flawless movie obviously i strongly recommend it maybe reading a bit about the real events beforehand will help the eventual viewing but dont read too much due to the usual spoilers ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog david finchers new film mank is coming soon on netflix released six years after his latest installment gone girl therefore this week im reviewing five of finchers movies se7en was the first one and now its time for one of the most culturally impactful films of the 90s fight club this is another rewatch of another filmmaking classic one that i was never able to absolutely adore like most people when this movie came out in 1999 critics were extremely divided and the film failed at the box office with time it gained a cult following through home media but its still considered a very controversial piece of cinema so nothing new having in mind fincher is at the helm despite this being my third or fourth time experiencing this story i never really changed my opinion about it which is a bit uncommon in my viewing history usually after multiple rewatches my overall thoughts about a movie slightly vary but fight club is one of the few exceptions i believe my opinion remains intact from the very first watch i really enjoy this film but i cant state that i absolutely love it since this is a special case im going to start with what still bothers me after so many viewings something i also rarely do in my reviews since i always leave the bad stuff to the end of the article without spoiling anything of course theres a vital plot twist that comes later in the movie that i could only appreciate by its execution but never by its impact on the narrative jim uhls screenplay relies on the main characters friendship to carry the story forward and throughout the first two acts fincher leaves notthatsubtle hints to a massive revelation which eventually triggers the beginning of the third act this major plot point is brilliantly executed and i still feel incredibly fascinated by its delivery both in terms of the dialogue and the performances however its impact on any lightly focused observant viewer is close to zero due to the clear evidence that pointed towards this development now i dont want to sound like that stereotypical moviegoer that says i guessed the twist before its revelation hence it all sucks like i insinuate above i was still wholly captivated during the entirety of the third act nevertheless fight clubs runtime is far from being short and fincher spends a lot of time building up an idea that loses its surprise factor even before the films midpoint it changes the protagonists perspective it takes the viewer through a predictable yet entertaining path setting up a powerful meaningful ending however personally i dont feel like the time spent in the first two acts was satisfyingly compensated in the end at least not in its entirety the second act also has a short period where it loses a bit of steam due to some repetitive sequences and an unnecessary amount of flashbacks again i feel like fincher didnt completely trust the audience back then contrary to his procedure in se7en in the latter flick fincher left the biggest responsibility to the viewers imagination leaving the murder scenes for the audience to picture in their minds in fight club that ambiguity and implicit dialogue are still present sure but even before the third act theres already an attempt to explain too much certain portions of the narrative that i wish would stay vaguer without spoiling anything of course theres a vital plot twist that comes later in the movie that i could only appreciate by its execution but never by its impact on the narrative jim uhls screenplay relies on the main characters friendship to carry the story forward and throughout the first two acts fincher leaves notthatsubtle hints to a massive revelation which eventually triggers

picture in their minds in fight club that ambiguity and implicit dialogue are still present sure but even before the third act theres already an attempt to explain too much certain portions of the narrative that i wish would stay vaguer dont worry im done with the negatives and dont forget i really really like this movie obviously fincher and uhls created a story packed with underlying themes and social commentary from the whole consumerism theory to the more psychological component regarding edward nortons mental state every message is seamlessly communicated to the audience ive also been through a point in my life where i wish id be someone else someone who had already achieved every dream of mine successfully with an overwhelming feeling of fulfillment coping with the inability to become that perfect someone can become an excruciating sad depressing process and it varies drastically from person to person fight club approaches mental health and peoples acceptance of who they truly are in a groundbreaking manner capturing edward nortons emotions perfectly and broadcasting his thoughts through some of the best narration in the history of cinema its take on the world of consumerism is undoubtedly interesting and plays a big part in the climax of the film despite the issues described above uhls screenplay is very wellwritten elevating the conversations between norton and brad pitt ad astra once upon a time in hollywood  which are indeed remarkably entertaining predictable or not the main story is wonderfully executed by fincher who continues to demonstrate his impressive technical attributes once again the preproduction phase is proved here to be as important as any other stage in the filmmaking process finchers dedication to his features is palpable and visible onscreen through every single technical aspect this time fincher brought in jeff cronenweth as the director of photography and both worked together to not only create that desaturated realistic atmosphere that fincher loves so much but also to deliver the brutal violent bloody fight scenes that keep the entertainment levels at their highest with clean consistent coherent editing from james haygood the movie flows beautifully despite its lengthy runtime the dust brothers score is quite alternative which suits the also unconventional storytelling last but not least edward norton and brad pitt i know its incredibly cliche to write that two actors share impeccable chemistry but norton and pitt take it to a whole other level in two physicallydemanding displays both actors deliver awardworthy performances that marked their careers pitt offers one of his most underrated portrayals being extremely funny throughout the entire film but also astonishingly badass carrying his fight sequences as amazing as he does with his dialogues on the other hand seeing norton go allout is a terrific experience i lack words to describe such an emotionally compelling interpretation filled with powerful character moments a final word of praise to helena bonham carter enola holmes  who also delivers an exceptional performance in the end fight club is and will probably remain david finchers most controversial movie for a long long time with an absolutely brilliant direction and execution fincher uses jim uhls captivating layered unconventional screenplay to tackle themes such as consumerism societys behavior and mental health seamlessly transmitting meaningful yet contentious messages once again the filmmaking in display is technically flawless going from the trademark authentic cinematography and production design to the unique score all flowing superbly through excellent editing unfortunately i dont belong to the group of people who utterly love this film the excessive sometimes unnecessary use of flashbacks doesnt help but its the enormous buildup packed with overly explicit clues to a significant yet unsurprising plot twist that ends up partially ruining the viewing for me i also wish that the script developed a few plot points more ambiguously but brad pitt and edward norton elevate the whole movie so much with their ridiculously outstanding performances that these small issues dont keep me away from highly recommending one of the most memorable iconic films of alltime ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog  with all due respect to roland emmerich and to his fantastic independence day his movies never quite reach their potential ending up in constant disappointments it doesnt matter if he has excellent casts or amazing vfx teams his films screenplays are almost always stuffed with narrative issues midway is simply another installment in his saga of letdowns without knowing the director anyone who looks at this movie will feel instantly captivated from the unbelievably talented cast to the impressive visuals it has two attentiongrabber ingredients which can result in a remarkable film only if the two pillars of any cinematic production are decent enough story and characters these are the main issue with emmerichs movies his characters are not compelling or intriguing enough and his screenplays lack creativity and excitement whether these are written by him or someone else  when i noticed that midway had such an acclaimed cast and that it was about the battle of midway i immediately got excited war epics are a genre that i sincerely appreciate however when i checked who was running the show i instantly lowered my expectations honestly its exactly what i expected it to be visually gripping but emotionally hollow i dont want to understate it the cgi work in this film is jawdropping the actual war is riveting with astonishing aerial sequences and powerful sound design even at a regular screening with the usual 71 dolby surround speakers the floor was rumbling with the explosions and the planes this is why i think audiences will definitely enjoy this movie maybe not a vast majority but surely most people will leave their theaters feeling it was good entertainment it has a long runtime and its hard to get through the expositionheavy story but in the end i bet the general public will appreciate the war action enough to give the whole thing a thumbs up nevertheless its still a very superficial flick while its very respectful to everyone who fought in the war including the japanese and to the historic event on itself it lacks emotional attachment to its characters dunkirk was praised by both critics and audiences all around the world but its main criticism connects to what i just wrote christopher nolans film also didnt have any compelling characters however theres a big difference between these two movies both their marketing and their ultimate goal are distinct dunkirk was all about showing the actual war it never marketed itself as a characterstudy or that it would even have a significant focus on some of the heroes that fought there nolan repeated several times its about the war and the war only its genuinely one of the best if not the best pure war film ive ever seen when it comes to depicting the claustrophobic unbreathable restless bloody loud event that a devastating war is dunkirk is so realistic it can even become uncomfortable with just sitting in your chair at least i did in imax  on the other hand midways marketing was about paying homage to people who fought in the battle of midway hence the stellar cast compared to nolans just competent actors with obvious exceptions like mark rylance or tom hardy  it spends most of its screentime trying to develop the actual people that helped win that battle not with the action itself therefore these characters need engaging scripts and emotionally resonant arcs wes tooke delivers a screenplay packed with so much exposition that a lot of it looks clearly unrealistic characters discuss specific topics that dont make any sense of being in a conversation at a particular time and place throughout the runtime there are dialogue sequences with the sole purpose of explicitly telling the audience what we need to know to understand the story which ends up turning the narrative confusing convoluted and lacking faster pacing its tough to get through the nonaction periods and i cant even imagine how dull it would be without such an impeccable cast ed skrein remarkably portrays dick best the only character whos genuinely compelling and carries a complete welldeveloped arc unfortunately i didnt feel invested in any other character only the best movies of every year can have a numerous and talented cast while giving each and every actor an exciting role midway has too many characters for the story it wants to tell in addition to this it has to stretch its runtime because you cant get woody harrelson or dennis quaid playing secondary roles and not giving them more than just a couple of lines as time goes by emmerichs storytelling structure gets needlessly more and more complicated to follow its yet another film added to the wasted potential list potential due to how truly magnificent the action sequences can be its undeniable that these are entertaining gripping and exciting the dive bombers scenes are packed with so much tension that i was getting more and more frustrated every time they missed their target and a bomb went into the sea i wanted them to succeed so bad and this feeling can only be triggered by something extraordinary midways war is as close to epic as it could be but as with every other cinematic production if its story and its characters are not up to par with the action there are no outstanding vfx that can save a lousy screenplay all in all midway is a respectful homage to the people who fought in the battle of midway but it fails to deliver an engaging story with compelling characters with more characters that what it needed the runtime is stretched beyond its limit due to the numerous acclaimed actors who would never be in a movie if they didnt have more than a couple of lines roland emmerich has to thank his vfx team for presenting the closest war action we could ever get of the famous battle truly epic visuals with tense and riveting aerial sequences plus a powerful sound design get your teeth biting the nails unfortunately except for ed skreins character i didnt feel invested enough to appreciate the nonaction moments due to the confusing convoluted and expositionheavy narrative its a shame that a visually impressive film possesses such an emotionally dull story however i still recommend it for anyone who enjoys war epics and based on a true story adaptations ps it doesnt hurt to research a bit about the battle of midway i didnt and im sort of regretting that now dont make the same mistake going in with basic knowledge of what how and why it happened will only help you enjoy this movie more  ",

its one of those films where the visuals elevate whatever narrative is being told if you dont get goosebumps or get excited with the opening sequence of this movie then it might not be the film youre looking for from the quiet but powerful sound design to the impressive cinematography james gray delivers a visually captivating story with an outstanding protagonist brad pitt is definitely getting tons of nominations this awards season lets not forget his amazing role in once upon a time in hollywood  his subtle yet incredibly emotional performance shows an astonishing range he carries the whole screenplay in his shoulders and i dont mind that at all theres a lot of narration and heres where i transition to the most divisive aspect of the movie its a slowburn now theres no problem with a film being deliberately slow in fact some of my favorite movies of alltime arent fastpaced they cherish their story and make the audience feel interested in what theyre experiencing ad astra isnt an action flick or a comedy its a characterdriven drama so most of the runtime is devoted to developing roy that said dont go in with expectations of feeling entertained all the time some moments arent supposed to excite you or leave you jawdropped some sequences are just meant to make you feel immersed by the environment be lost in space imax is the mandatory way of watching this feature  dont expect the film to make an 80day trip to some planet end in two cuts and 20 seconds gray purposefully establishes a slow pace obviously general audiences dont usually enjoy this type of flicks but if youre able to manage your expectations realistically youre one step closer to not feel bored throughout the runtime the first act is the one that captures everyones attention it doesnt waste time on earth it goes through whats happening pretty quickly and it possesses 90 of the heavy action including one of the best opening sequences of the year  sound has a significant impact on how gray films his sequences and its unbelievable how wellshot the chasing scenes on the moon are scientifically speaking this is no interstellar where you simply have to accept some mindblowing yet unjustified stuff ad astra doesnt have a single scene where one might think this completely takes me out of the movie i cant accept that this is possible in some fictional future this is a huge compliment to a space film containing several launches lunar bases and very long space journeys however the remaining two acts focus intensely on pitts character slowing down the main plot like i wrote above theres a lot of development through roys thoughts extensive narration is almost always an issue even when the narrator is brad pitt some monologues do indeed develop the character or explain what hes feeling but some tend to fall into the philosophical side that doesnt always carry a meaningful or interesting message using everyday language sometimes its a bit boring additionally the ending might be a letdown for a lot of people tommy lee jones h clifford mcbride doesnt have a lot of screentime and i cant really delve into details about his storyline but his characters relationship with roy doesnt exactly serve as a fantastic payoff max richters score is one of 2019s best and i hope it gets recognized by every award show it definitely helps the experience to be more enthralling the lack of sound in space is also powerful in its own way beautifullyedited but with a continuously slow pace that doesnt change from the moment the second act begins however the story of ad astra is vastly superior to for example grays the lost city of z which i genuinely disliked this space adventure is visually more exciting its story is more engaging and its protagonist is more compelling than everything else in grays previous installment finally its one of those movies that watching at a film theater mainly imax or at home makes a massive difference youll never feel as entertained or captivated at home so make sure to check this one at the best possible screen near you all in all ad astra is yet another display case for brad pitts chances at winning an oscar with a subtle yet powerful performance pitt carries the whole story to safe harbor with tremendous help from the eyegasmic visuals technically its one of 2019s closest movies to being perfect very wellshot welledited with an immersive score and gorgeous cinematography however its a slowburn that doesnt always work as such narration is the goto method to develop pitts character and while it works most of the time it slows down the main plot becoming a tad boring during a few moments the ending isnt the impactful payoff that the film needed and the incredible supporting cast is underutilized in the end its still a great movie and one that should be seen at the biggest and best screen possible so go see it for yourself  ",

genre dc has been on a streak of great films within its universe so an isolated installment definitely excites me especially about one of the evilest villains ever its by far one of the less comicbooky flicks of the century it doesnt follow the generic origin story formula it avoids any cliches associated with the genre and its the type of movie thats becoming more and more rare nowadays its a character study like we havent seen in a long time ill simply begin with the person that elevates the entire thing joaquin phoenix now if theres something im not going to do is compare his performance with heath ledgers thats the number one mistake people are going to keep making forever first of all the dark knight and joker couldnt be more distinct films even if they belong to the same genre despite joker being unique its still about a famous comicbook villain  then despite phoenix and ledger portraying the same version of the clown crazy sadistic psychopath  the former is 90 arthur fleck while the latter is 100 joker throughout each of their movies finally phoenix is the sole protagonist of this feature while ledger had the best liveaction batman sharing the spotlight in conclusion its both unfair and a bit unreasonable to compare both interpretations since their roles have a different impact on the narrative as well as each film being entirely different in the end both are impressive however lets switch to phoenix since hes the star of this show he has 2019s best performance by far with a strong marketing campaign im sure hell get that oscar i hope so its so welldeserved todd phillips and scott silver developed a brilliant screenplay but phoenix elevates it to a whole other level throughout the entire runtime i felt weird perturbed even uncomfortable with what i was watching and consequently feeling its a dark brutal violent emotionally powerful origin of a villain who i feel disturbingly empathetic towards phoenix makes the story work due to its remarkably captivating display of someone whos mentally ill arthur fleck slowly becoming crazier is due to how society behaves and not due to some chemical pool that transforms his skin white and hair green nothing wrong with this but i know which origin story i prefer  the world is getting crazier out there and it becomes excruciatingly painful to deal with it especially when so much is going on with arthurs personal life and most of it he doesnt even realize because he tries to hide everything behind a smile its a screenplay filled with narrative twists that not only pack a punch of surprise but leave you feeling extremely upset the last act is one of the best in the last few years if the second act is an enormous buildup the last one is a terrific payoff i cant remember the last movie i saw where i loved 100 every single narrative decision i wouldnt do any of the big moments differently there are so many excellent references hidden in plain sight that comicbook fans and fans of the tdk trilogy as well will love just like i did in the ending theres one pivotal moment in particular that serves as the absolute climax i got chills all over my body they couldnt have done that scene more perfect i only have one tiny nitpick with the way some scenes feel repetitive since they neither move the plot forward or give us anything new some of these still help to create tension some feel like theyre just there a best picture and best actor nominations seem to be on its way but these are not the only achievements that deserve to be recognized the original score by hildur gu nad ttir is incredibly addictive so much that im listening to it while writing this review it definitely helps to generate tremendous buildup and it elevates the sinister environment of gotham city lawrence shers cinematography is utterly stunning the underexposure of some scenes is glorious sher paints the screen with so many gorgeous shots especially with his closeups on phoenix where the latter is able to shine jeff groth is also impeccable in the editing room there are several long takes with phoenix just giving his all and letting all his emotions out or keeping them all contained  which is always something i deeply appreciate since it helps with the flow of the narrative regarding the films controversy surrounding its messages and the incentive to violence i really dont know what to say its ridiculous i remember those times when going into the movie theater was a surreal experience it was the number one place for people to forget about their lives jobs everything joker is a fictional story its the origin of one of the worst psychopaths in the history of comicbooks and cinema if people expected to leave the theater happy or joyful then at least one of the films message is right society really is getting crazier have people forgotten who joker is what could you possibly expect from his origin story nowadays no one knows how to behave social media is the primary source for spreading hate  no one respects the fellow citizen or even the world itself more and more people only look at their own bellies political agendas are everywhere new extreme movements are created every other year social hypersensibility is exponentially growing the same way some people will hate this movie for not being able or simply not wanting to accept that they feel empathy towards a murderer people all around the world behave like their actions dont reflect on another persons life and on their own planet if people get ruthlessly violent because they watched joker how can someone complain that the films message is bad when its eventually true all in all joker is one of the best movies of the year and its definitely on my top3 at the date of this review joaquin phoenix delivers my favorite male performance of 2019 by elevating a script about the origin of one of the evilest villains ever the way he gradually becomes more insane is worthy of study but its how hes able to make the audience create empathy towards a psychopath that leaves me disturbingly captivated todd phillips produces a characterstudy filled with an astonishingly tense buildup and one of the most chillinducing payoffs of the last few years with every single narrative decision nailed perfectly hildur gu nad ttirs score and lawrence shers cinematography stand out the lack of restraint in showing the unmerciful violence physical and mental that society inflicts on one another is what makes us feel unsettled because we know its mostly true and we refuse to accept it its not a film about the joker its a very realistic portrayal of someone anyone who can become someone like him and its disturbingly brilliant ps robert deniro murray franklin and zazie beetz sophie dumond are also great

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog  this was easily one of my most anticipated movies of the year hereditary was my favorite film of 2018 so obviously ari asters second feature grabbed my full attention from the very first announcement fortunately even though midsommar is only being released now in my country i was able to stay away from spoilers as well as from any sort of images or clips as you might expect this is not a typical horror movie even though its being marketed as belonging to the genre sure it has some horror stuff that indisputably connects it to the genre but it definitely doesnt play out to scare audiences or make you have nightmares at night hereditary was quite divisive among audiences due to the lack of traditional jump scares and generic entertainment besides it being too excessive regarding spiritualism for the general public midsommar is undoubtedly going to be even more divisive first of all it drags theres no denying it the first weird cult scene only occurs about one hour in which in a 140minute runtime is a bit too far ahead granted its one of the most shocking and horrific sequences in the daylight ive ever seen but its buildup extremely welldone takes a big part of the second act slowing down the pacing too much additionally its a film that entirely relies its entertainment value on the feeling of shock instead of fear if you didnt enjoy asters first feature because it didnt have enough scary sequences midsommar isnt going to convert you to being a fan of his work similarly to ad astra just released last week  its a story that requires the audience to care about more than only superficial aspects if you go in expecting to leave your brain outside just so you can be uncloudedly entertained then you might want to think again i cant stress this enough you need to pay attention to what youre watching hints to what the story holds for us are everywhere especially in the walls through paintings runes and handdrawings ari aster spreads basically all the information you need to better understand where the movie is going its a film about two key themes how to deal with grief and how to handle a complicated relationship these are the issues that people should be able to acknowledge and understand how theyre being developed i love how aster addresses the latter topic he wrote this screenplay after he ended a relationship of his own  but im disappointed by the way he put the former into the background the first 1520 minutes deal with what happens to danis life and its never approached again even though theres a vague idea of what could have actually happened by the end of the movie regarding the other point it isnt exactly a toxic relationship that weve seen in previous films but one where each person is waiting for an excuse to leave the other hence some actions feel forced in the hope that they can trigger something its a strangely realistic yet uncomfortable take on something a lot of people go through technically this is one of 2019s most fascinating productions from the colorful cinematography to the impeccable editing from the stunningly impressive production design again the walls to the immersive score ari aster is no joke the way he handles dialogues is a treat to someone like me who cares so much about engagement through characters speaking there are so many long takes with florence pugh giving her all just raw and powerful emotions its her careerbest performance no doubt about it her characters storyline is partially what brings the horror to the narrative just like toni colette on hereditary pugh is probably going to be ignored during the awards season as well as the movies technical achievements since the horror genre still didnt convince enough people to give a shot regarding the other characters theyre my main issue they simply felt like plot devices will poulter mark is funny as the comicrelief guy but his character like every other one besides dani doesnt do much to make me care about or feel invested in their own subplots if there are any  they barely have any backstory and their purpose is basically to help move the plot forward by giving aster opportunities to show some pagan rituals of some kind there are incredibly shocking bloody and jawdropping scenes some might make you feel uncomfortable others might make you laugh but theyre all meant to shock you in some shape or form whether you love it or hate it midsommar is memorable if you didnt enjoy hereditary due to the lack of jump scares the former isnt for you then midsommar requires full attention patience and an openminded mentality its not a generic horror flick so dont go in expecting to be constantly entertained by silly scares expectations are everything so moderate them in the best way possible it has one of the most abstract ways of addressing a difficult relationship and how to deal with grief but if you look at the walls youll be able to maybe follow the story a bit better technically ari aster delivers a masterful work with exceptional production design and gorgeous cinematography plus seamless editing florence pugh carries the story on her shoulders with an astonishingly compelling performance but her supporting cast didnt do much with their underdeveloped characters the film drags a lot and it can become tedious at some point but in the end its one of those movies that sticks with you a second viewing may be necessary and it will probably be a better experience cant wait to find out go see it ",

pandemic so i didnt have that many films for which i felt incredibly excited i love pretty much everything that pixar puts out and at the start of 2020 i noticed that the studio was releasing not one but two original animated movies something quite uncommon in their history only happened in 2015 and 2017  onward was yet another success but everyone knew soul was the studios big gun december release date means better chances to win an oscar and the highly anticipated return of pete docter monsters inc up inside out to the director and writers chairs also elevates the films expectations im no different my expectations were high as the sky but the main question in my mind wasnt really if soul was going to be a great movie but if it would be so good id love it more than wolfwalkers my favorite animated flick of the year so far well let me write that its a wonderful beautiful heartwarming tie i love them both very much and i wouldnt be surprised if i saw them in my top10 however this is souls spotlight so let me get to it and spit out the only minor issue i have with the film during the first act i couldnt feel a connection to the story nor the characters it took me a while to really get fully invested in the narrative and even technical aspects such as the animation style and the score trent reznor atticus ross felt weirdly outofplace and surprisingly not that enthralling nevertheless this slow unconvincing beginning doesnt negatively impact the movie overall as most of these apparently awkward components improve as time goes by from the moment it clicked with me i went on that emotional rollercoaster i always expect to ride in a pixar feature the studio is known for its extremely heartfelt shocking tearinducing third acts and even though soul isnt an exception to that rule its far from being one of those mindblowing jawdropping devastating final minutes its third act is astonishingly emotional and it sends a lovely message to the audience one that made me reflect on the entire year and a specific moment in my life pete docter mike jones and kemp powers explore the taboo subject of lifes meaning in a predictable yet profound and entertaining manner the approach on philosophical questions like whats my purpose whats my spark or what does it mean to have a soul is cleverly developed and very wellwritten theres a sequence with the protagonist near the end that will make tons of viewers experience it simultaneously i found myself rewatching this scene in particular to help me remember a certain period in my life where i realized that what i thought was my destiny was in fact just one of those life passions that leave us with unforgettable memories i was able to deal with that moment pretty well but many people lose themselves once they figure out that what they thought they were meant to do be isnt really what the future holds for them they become lost souls and only a spark of life can revitalize them soul explores this matter in such an authentic genuine creative way that i couldnt help but cry as i do in every pixar film watching soul will make you appreciate life a lot more especially those tiny little moments that we forget to remember living with all its horrible phases is the best life experience anyone can have after a year of isolation and separation from the people we love this movie arrives at the perfect time technically the animation style and score didnt convince me in the first few minutes but by the end theyre part of the key aspects that made me cry like a baby trent reznor and atticus ross are starting to become two of my favorite composers the social network gone girl mank  pete docter proves that his undeniable talent behind the screen remains intact and this time he introduces hollywood to the debutants kemp powers and mike jones jamie foxx and tina fey 22 deliver some terrific voice work so expect them to receive dozens of nominations finally congratulations to every single artist that worked on this films animation these gifted people are the real stars of pixar all in all soul is everything i expected it to be a classic pixar feature with the trademark emotionally powerful third act a heartwarming sweet tearinducing score and a relatable profound wellexplored story about our own soul and the meaning of life pete docter delivers another awardworthy flick with the help of kemp powers and mike jones and with the outstanding voices of jamie foxx and tina fey it may start slow and follow a predictable path but its only a matter of time until every viewer connects with the main characters soul surpasses the barriers of cinema becoming a healing media from which people can take away so so much it works seamlessly as a reflection on life and as a motivation to truly live every single moment of it its the ideal movie to watch on the morning of christmas day with the entire family cozy and warm in the living room i promise you it will make you

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog at the time of this review malcolm marie is already dividing critics worldwide which is far from being surprising having in mind its expectedly provocative premise being a film critic isnt exactly an easy task especially when it comes to deal with public opinion in most cases when one reaches a high level of success that always comes with a heavy dose of offensive tweets and personal attacks particularly when the authors opinion contradicts the audiences response so i was hoping that sam levinson would not contribute to the dozens of misconceptions surrounding film criticism and hundreds of conspiracy theories regarding journalists of the respective area unfortunately the extremely exaggerated borderline offensive overthetop monologues  kind word for rants  delivered by malcolm john david washington are simply more wood thrown to the already devastating fire what starts as a surprisingly rational thoughtprovoking comment on how some critics tend to make movies about something these arent attempting to be  mainly emphasizing a nonexistent political or racial message  quickly evolves to scenes featuring a childish immature selfabsorbed behavior from the male protagonist who blindly attacks hypothetical reviews from in his opinion horrible critics even though this is somewhat of a niche subject for the general audience its still a negative contribution to a challenging problem film critics face every day ive read the following comment more than a couple of times already sam levinson is using a black actor to transmit his white male directors frustrations on the industrys reviewers in my opinion whoever wrote something similar to this is falling into the exact same error malcolm aggressively accuses critics of doing reading too much into it and once again bringing race to a discussion where it doesnt belong it doesnt really matter if the screenplay is written by a frustrated levinson who decided to let out his thoughts about film criticism or by someone else entirely ultimately the characters are one of the main pillars of any movie and sadly theyre my main issue with the whole story despite the prologue above that i couldnt help not writing malcolm marie focuses on the toxic relationship of the two unlikable protagonists the adjectives used in the last sentence are hardly untrue malcolm and marie spend almost the entire runtime in a tiresome exhausting headacheinducing cycle of incredibly exaggerated fights followed by a temporary reconciliation by making out for a couple of minutes before the next big argument begins as soon as i finished the film marriage story came to my mind and i vividly remember tearing up when the main characters had that massive fight why did i feel so bothered and uncomfortable with malcolm and marie then because of their personalities malcolm is nothing more than a cocky egocentric selfindulgent filmmaker who believes hes the king of the world now that he delivered a good movie pride and arrogance are separated by a thin line but malcolm definitely incorporates the arrogant persona who cant even show signs of gratitude when positive reviews come in  instead delivers another rant on how the respective author didnt understand his film on the other hand marie zendaya starts as an apparently nice hardworking lovable young woman who just got stuck with the wrong man seemingly working as the equilibrium point in their relationship i do feel sorry for a lot of things that happened to her however marie quickly demonstrates that shes far from being a perfect girlfriend despite being much more tolerable and less unlikable than malcolm marie carries unforgivable mistakes from her past and shows an inability to accept that malcolm might have drawn inspiration from someone else with constant attempts at victimization and a certain amount of jealousy marie is the trigger for most of the arguments that come up out of nowhere each time the two reconcile in the end this is the reason why i felt so much more emotionally invested in the protagonists of marriage story i deeply cared about these characters and their respective lives not only i understood what drove them apart but i could actually relate to some of it malcolm might have made a beautiful movie partially based on his relationship with marie but its still a toxic damaging romance that no one should ever need to deal with even though the beforementioned problems are indeed heavy negatives malcolm marie still possesses a lot of qualities worthy of deep appreciation levinson might share the same views on film criticism as malcolm but his talent as a director is undeniable his brilliant use of excruciatingly long takes plays a significant role in elevating the intensity and attention levels of every dialogue and monologue marcell r vs cinematography  who previously worked with levinson in euphoria  is either based on tracking shots to follow each character across the neverending halls and rooms of the house or static images to let the actors shine in their line deliveries r v waits for just the right moment to finally move the camera near the character after extensive uncut minutes of impressive work from the movies absolute standouts the actors john david washingtons performance in tenet wasnt universally loved and even though i really enjoyed his display i didnt know where his career would go from there well his portrayal of malcolm may be a bit too overthetop for some peoples taste but despite my despise for the character only a blind viewer would not value washingtons outstanding interpretation in a surprisingly more physical display than i anticipated washington literally offers his entire body and voice to his character not forgetting a single facial expression or body movement as uncomfortable as his rants on film criticism are i have to show appreciation for the actors ability to actually make me feel like that nevertheless this is zendayas show in fact i wont be surprised by the inevitable nominations coming her way for someone who never watched euphoria or only has her performance as mj in spiderman homecoming and spiderman far from home as an example her portrayal of marie will surely shock many viewers from the incredible control of subtle emotions certain scenes ask for to the extremely captivating monologues  something both actors tackle superbly  zendaya delivers her careers best performance in a feature film an emotionally powerful display that i wont forget so soon a final praise to labrinths score which plays a meaningful part in the storytelling malcolm marie is technically impressive  gorgeous cinematography and impactful score  boasting two phenomenal performances but its complicated screenplay and characters push me to the negative side from the overly exaggerated almost offensive rants on film criticism and the areas professionals to the tiresome overthetop cycle of fightreconciliation sam levinsons undeniable talent as a director is overpowered by the two incredibly unlikable protagonists who are mutually damaging each other in their unquestionably toxic relationship despite the exceptionally captivating effort from john david washington and especially zendaya who delivers a careerbest interpretation the feeling of discomfort and distress never goes away malcolm is a completely intolerable arrogant filmmaker and even though i genuinely felt sorry for marie at one point the latter eventually proves that shes far from being a better person since one of its central topics of discussion is a bit too niche for general audiences it will probably find its commercial success through netflix personally its my first major disappointment of 2021 ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog  theres this misconceived idea that scary movies are the ones with demons monsters or ghosts literally showing up in jump scare sequences one after another accompanied by an extremely loud sound granted were scared of what were scared of no debate here however one common complaint about this type of horror films is that they arent scary enough i couldnt disagree more these movies are the ones that truly get to us and stay with us for a while if we watch a film with cyclical jump scares were going to forget about it as soon as we leave the theater movies with a horrific story based on relatable themes those are the ones that leave us uncomfortable and disturbed im just writing this prologue to say that you shouldnt go in expecting a scary film at least not in a mainstream way moving on as you probably know by now if you dont check out my the shinings review  im a huge fan of stanley kubricks adaptation of stephen kings novel of the same name its a cult classic horror movie one that influenced generations to come especially regarding filmmaking techniques and equipment with that said mike flanagan had one of the toughest jobs of 2019 not only did he need to deliver a sequel worthy of being associated with a beloved classic but he had to deal with all the differences between the source material and kubricks changes im going to leave a spoiler warning for the shining since the film came out 40 years ago and i already wrote a review about it still spoilerfree for doctor sleep dont worry in case you dont know the major difference between kings book and kubricks cinematic adaptation is the ending in the book jack torrance forgets to relieve the hotel boilers pressure and it explodes destroying the hotel and killing jack in the process in kubricks movie jack freezes to death in the maze outside the hotel while chasing his son while the hotel stands tall flanagan is able to do the impossible he perfectly continues the story left by kubrick while respecting kings demands just dont go with a purist mentality thinking that flanagan doesnt have the right to explore and expand the shining its a sequel so expect things to be added to the story nothing is removed or retconned so relax  as long as it makes sense be always open to new ideas as the director flanagan proves once again hes a pretty talented guy by seamlessly recreating some of the shinings most iconic scenes but also by delivering some tricks of his own with the help of his amazing cinematographer michael fimognari they are able to generate incredible levels of tension characteristic of the original film as the editor he puts together everything remarkably well the sequences inside someones mind are wonderfully handled and provide some of the best moments of the entire movie however theres a massive difference when it comes to how the runtime flows in each film both cross the 140minute mark and both purposefully employ slow pacing nevertheless the shining feels like it goes by way faster than doctor sleep and mathematically it does have less 510 minutes but thats not the point  why due to kubricks movie constantly having long takes and extense dialogues while flanagans installment has a modern approach with regular cuts plus much more action audiences presumably wont think of this its not like the average joe notices or even cares if a scene has been going for 5 minutes straight or pieced together with 50 cuts  and just assume that the latter is more boring than the first without really understanding why people will probably blindly blame the story but doctor sleep has a lot more blockbuster entertainment than the shining the latter is pretty much two hours spent inside a hotel where dialogue is the primary source of entertainment things only go crazy in the last 1520 minutes  and we all know that the general public usually doesnt fall for that the sequel has a lot more action subplots and characters so the runtime should go by faster than the original right no this film is the number one proof that im going to use from now on to defend that uncut dialogue sequences and overall long takes are the best way of managing an extended runtime without it feeling too heavy especially in a psychological horror flick i wrote all these last paragraphs not to complain about the movies being too slow too long or too dull im just trying to help everyone understand why the film might feel slower and much longer while protecting its story because the screenplay is indeed extremely wellwritten like in the original exposition is handled beautifully with scarce lazy displays but its the characters of ewan mcgregor and the debutant kyliegh curran that carry the narrative effortlessly mcgregor is the perfect casting as danny torrance and he does a great job of embodying dans personality however its dannys journey through his young and adult years that impresses me exceptional character development dannys life after the events at the overlook hotel is as realistic and logical as it could be flanagan does a phenomenal job in handling this character and throwing just the right obstacles in his path the way he deals with the aftermath of the shining how he grows up as a man and even what he ends up doing for a living everything is absolutely perfect furthermore hes not alone abra is a badass young girl who wants to use her shine to protect others but this time its the actress that steals the spotlight from the character kyliegh curran delivers one of the best young acting debuts ive ever witnessed shes wonderful as abra and her range of emotions is already surprisingly vast she has some of the best scenes of the movie especially when shes fighting rose the hat but here is where we get to my major issue with the film rebecca ferguson gives an outstanding performance no doubt about it she elevates infinite sequences giving 200 to her role however her character and the true knot group are the only significant flaw of this sequel when writing a villain there are basically two paths for success either make the bad guy a compelling character with whom the audience can create some sort of empathy with and understand where he she comes from or turn him her into a menacing powerful scary force that makes us fear for our heroes flanagan apparently chooses the latter route and unfortunately its his only misstep i dont know if king didnt allow for changes to rose or the true knot cult but they dont quite work when adapting to the big screen not only their history is never truly explored but their motivations are too shallow so i didnt care for a single character from the group not even rose if she was the menacing powerful scary force that i wrote above this wouldnt be so important but the truth is she isnt as the narrative progresses theres a constant reminder that our heroes are in danger and that rose is astonishingly strong but the interactions between her and abra prove the contrary so i never really felt frightened or overwhelmed by her a decent portion of runtime is handed to roses group but its development didnt work for me at all theyre not bad villains and theyre still more fleshed out that a lot of characters in horror movies i just think somethings missing nevertheless thats the only major problem i have with the movie for true fans of the shining the countless references and easter eggs are such a delight theres good and bad fanservice the one present in this sequel only appears after we are already invested in the story and its characters demonstrating once more flanagans talent  from the haunting and addictive score that the newton brothers are able to seamlessly adapt to the sequel to the influential kubricks framing flanagan and his team produce something pretty extraordinary having in mind this is a sequel to one of the most beloved horror films of alltime in the end doctor sleep might be the first sequel remake reboot whatever to a cult classic movie that doesnt diminish the original disgracefully copies it or takes something away from it while actually being an individually great film with a captivating narrative and compelling leads plus the right amount of homages to the classic mike flanagan took the impossible task of balancing both stephen kings the shining and stanley kubricks cinematic adaptation and successfully nailed pretty much everything regarding the connection between the main stories in addition to the slow pacing not working as well as in the original the true knot group is the big stumble in an otherwise pretty consistent screenplay however the phenomenal cast with a terrific debut performance from kyliegh curran elevate every scene ultimately driving the sequel to a nostalgiafull ending that will turn out to be divisive among fans i stand on the good side therefore i genuinely appreciate this movie if youre a fan of the original you cant miss this one ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog 2020 is unquestionably one of the most challenging years movie theaters ever had to face the still going global pandemic closed down everything including my favorite place to spend the most wonderful time therefore the already growing streaming services got a huge bump earning more and more subscribers during this tough phase in our lives netflix has been extremely busy releasing brandnew flicks since the beginning of the year being the devil all the time im thinking of ending things and project power the latest some better than others but im still to find a 2020s original film from the studio that i genuinely dislike is enola holmes the first one well no far from that with such a talented cast and high production value a new take on the classic sherlock holmes mysteries is certainly welcome and this is one of my top two compliments debutant director harry bradbeer and jack thorne his dark materials offer a refreshing twist on the famous detectives stories not only by focusing on her less popular sister instead but also by delivering a different sherlock than the one were used to seeing the editing adam bosman  cinematography giles nuttgens  and score daniel pemberton contribute to quirky fun captivating scenes that help the viewer follow enolas assessment of several situations including her thought process interpretation of clues formulating plans  most of the times by breaking the fourth wall this last aspect takes me to my other top two praise millie bobby brown shes the reason why these sequences work so well from the moment i first saw her in stranger things i genuinely believed she would be a star for the past few years ive constantly left in writing that she will break the oscars record for the youngest actress to ever win a best actress award millie still has a bit more than five years to achieve that and shes already leading major blockbusters like godzilla king of the monsters with this netflix movie millie proves once again her versatility already portrayed completely different characters in distinct genres  emotional range effortlessly delivers any type of scene  and mature acting rarely overacts or doesnt offer enough shes always on point  she incorporates enola in such a unique manner that i struggle to find a better choice to play this character who is herself also a standout enolas arc feels genuinely empowering it doesnt feel like a forced political statement nor a narratively illogical decision to develop this character in the way thorne does every enigma she tries to decipher every plan she needs to create to save someone or something every choice she makes feels earned and justified enola doesnt let herself be restricted by old societys rules of how the world should work she wants to be herself without having to answer to nobody it might be a generic message but its transmitted through seamless execution regarding the rest of the cast henry cavill is a major surprise as sherlock and i wont be shocked if it generates some controversy update it did  its a notably different version of the distant emotionless overly analytical sherlock that robert downey jr and benedict cumberbatch interpreted which i embrace with open arms i dont care about rights or origins a character is what the actor and writer s make of it it doesnt belong to anyone let alone its fans cavill shows a cheekier display than what hes used to presenting and thorne adjusted a couple of specific traits from the classic character louis partridge and sam claflin are both excellent as lord viscount tewksbury and mycroft respectively the remaining actors all offer decent performances but the two standouts are undoubtedly millie and cavill as for the film itself i was ready to write its fine half an hour before i finished it even though it feels unique in several areas enola holmes still follows a pretty generic story with formulaic plot points and the usual character drama sadly it doesnt really bring anything new storywise it features no surprises which is not a good attribute for a movie with a central mystery however that lack of enthusiasm leads me to a significant issue i didnt expect to find in the latter half of the film its mystery isnt truly one and its set aside midway through the movie which is a questionable narrative decision i dont remember the last time if ever where a film completely discards its main storyline one that received an entire first act of set up  replacing it with a youngadult romantic endeavor which is pretty convincing but not as a main storyline  im a firm advocate of the trailerfree methodology expectations can make or break the viewers opinion about a movie and nowadays trailers can be deceiving misleading and show way too much i missed everything related to this film watching it 100 blind had i watched enola holmes official trailer beforehand id definitely be inclined to the negative side of the divisive line i stand on right now its trailer focuses on what most people will expect from the movie the main mystery surrounding enolas mother disappearance considering how the film actually goes its safe to write that its trailer is a bit deceiving all in all enola holmes offers a pleasant refreshing take on a franchise that might have a new future now focusing on sherlock holmes sister harry bradbeer and jack thorne deliver a light fun entertaining story packed with action clues to decipher and a brilliant cast millie bobby brown keeps climbing up the stairs of success demonstrating her versatility range and maturity as a young actress its a matter of time until she becomes one of the most coveted actresses in hollywood her chemistry with henry cavill and louis partridge is phenomenal and her fourth wall breaks are fascinating technically enolas thoughts and feelings are perfectly transmitted to the audience through outstanding editing cinematography and score however storywise its as generic as it could be boasting absolutely no surprises and a central mystery thats not quite one its still a fine saturday night flick to enjoy with family and friends but be advised its trailer is a tad misleading so keep your mind open and expectations grounded ",

by myself cruella might just be another liveaction film from the mickey mouse studio but its far from being yet another remake much on the contrary just like the vast majority of the companys villains cruella de vil portrayed by glenn close in the previous installments was even worse than the generic antagonist with cliche motivations that eventually every studio used and reused to exhaustion besides cruellas greedy necessities purely evil personality and extreme vanity this wicked character was driven by something completely unthinkable skinning shorthaired puppies to have more success in the fashion industry due to their soft fur anyone with a conscience knows that disney would never bring this character back to the big screen in 2021 without making some changes especially regarding this motivation in particular how would a movie with a dogkilling protagonist at its front and center be remotely successful obviously this hardcore motif no longer belongs to emma stones cruellas

glamorous rich people that the baroness surrounds herself with and the dirty poor friends estella meets at the beginning of the movie  jasper joel fry and horace paul walter hauser  is also accentuated through their wardrobes the extravagant parties are packed with oscarworthy costumes but also with beautiful makeup hair nadia stacey and absolutely ravishing production design fiona crombie  nicholas britells score carries little references to the music of the other installments as does the film itself craig gillespie doesnt hide the easter eggs spread throughout the runtime of which some will definitely please the most avid fans technically its as gorgeous as one came to expect from the studio but not everything is as impressive as the aspects above in a movie where even the blackandwhite hair and clothes of cruella pop off the screen the cgi backgrounds and animals are way too noticeable for the studio that just made a hyperrealistic remake of the lion king cgi dogs are employed during most of the runtime which is not only understandable but also commendable animal violence in filmmaking is a serious topic that fortunately was solved long ago however the vfx dont look good enough causing the dogs  mainly the dalmatians  to be an unintended distraction in addition to this a specific outdoor location thats quite important to the story is surrounded by an awfully dark fake background that just feels way too off finally the ending boasts a ridiculous sequence made with terrible cgi that will definitely leave the more logicdriven viewers stunned with disappointment i consider this a nitpick especially since its not a film without silliness in fact cruellas success partially rests on gillespies tone balance jasper and horace become the comicrelief characters starring in the absurd action sequences that occur at parties and other places they decide to steal from now some people might expect that since the other movies are defined by their irrational fun however dana fox and tony mcnamaras screenplay carries undeniable similarities to the devil wears prada and the most recent joker estellas life story is far from being a happy tale and cruellas rise even less overall the balance between the silly comedy and the more dramatic depressing traumatic storyline is mostly wellhandled but there are a few moments where gillespie lets it too loose especially in the overdisneyish last fifteen minutes so lets address the two protagonists estella and cruella the comparisons with joaquin phoenixs take on arthur fleck joker are impossible to unsee from the upbringing filled with bullying and family tragedy to the final transformation emma stones character follows a similar arc but with clear differences concerning the solution for her problems estella dreams of being a fashion designer and idolizes the selfcentered selfindulgent baroness which takes her down a learning path of how to be successful in the business the baroness despicable treatment of estella brings the ruthless cruella gradually back to life eventually stealing the spotlight from the lovely little estella who just wanted to do what she loved for a living without having to carry on extreme measures an unexpected clever twist pretty much completes the protagonists transformation which genuinely caught me by surprise i admit that i didnt have high hopes for this origin story nevertheless the wellwritten screenplay deeply explores a previously hollow villain offering her a touching backstory and comprehensible motivations while its true that she possesses dozens of identical characteristics to the infamous baroness cruella never truly becomes 100 that person honestly i wouldnt mind seeing a sequel but i dont think theres room for another film that wouldnt hurt the one we just got so theres just one more aspect to delve into the casts performances joel fry and paul walter hauser are truly hilarious as the famous duo of thieves both share a compelling connection to estella one that i believe deserved a better conclusion they become a family living and stealing throughout their lives but when estella starts giving cruella some screentime a few issues arise within the trio these problems are indeed approached and solved but in a less dramatic manner than i hoped for fry is excellent as the more competent rational jasper but hauser never stops being extremely funny the beforementioned balance is rarely affected by the characters comedic banter which is something the actors also deserve credit for emma thompson delivers one of my favorite performances of her recent filmography interpreting the baroness von hellman how can you make an extremely overthetop character feel cartoonish yet strangely real someone who clearly feels like an exaggeration of a stereotype but still resembles dozens of people from the real world thompson takes her role and the only reason why she doesnt steal the spotlight from everyone else is because the other emma rises to the challenge of portraying such a classic villain with obvious references to miranda priestly from the devil wears prada thompson is able to be amusing and vile in the same scene making every second with her on screen feel incredibly captivating nevertheless emma stone manages to stay a level above everyone else i firmly believe that shes one of the best actresses of her generation carrying one of the most expressive faces in hollywood stone was born to play a protagonist with two personalities without looking at the screen any viewer will be able to know if shes talking as estella or cruella not only she changes the tone of her voice depending on the character but the mannerisms alter as well it would be a massive surprise if such an early disney performance got an oscar nomination so her chances are obviously thin however if there was an award for best monologue stone would be a strong contender i dont recall how many minutes it really is but i cant forget that long uncut take with stone at the center of the screen with nothing but her acting the hell out of an emotionally impactful monologue switching between estella and cruella in the span of milliseconds her microexpressions elevate a heartfelt characterdefining speech that will undoubtedly mark this year of cinema stone gives not one but two impressive attentiongrabbing performances that will satisfy most viewers looking for a cruella they can understand and even root for cruella is not only one of 2021s biggest surprises but its also one of the best movies of the year so far despite the occasional lack of balance between the silly comedy and the dramatic narrative craig gillespie offers an incredibly captivating origin al story about one of disneys classic villains dana fox and tony mcnamaras remarkable screenplay profoundly explores the estellacruella transformation giving her nondogkilling emotionally compelling motivations a traumatic depressing past and an unexpected twist that will probably catch most viewers offguard with one of her best performances ever emma stone delivers an awardworthy display interpreting two personalities in impressive fashion stealing the spotlight from the other outstanding interpretations technically the distracting cgi in animals and some noticeable greenscreen dont overcome the predictably oscarwinning stunning costume design as well as the gorgeous makeup hair wonderful production design and sweet score packed with excellent song choices a character study that makes this one of disneys best liveaction films in the last couple of decades ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog artemis fowl was the first film exclusively released on disney that i put my eyes on and it will undoubtedly end up as one of the worst movies of 2020 from that moment on i couldnt help but feel a bit skeptical about disney deciding to place films initially intended for a theatrical release in their streaming service which is the case of the one and only ivan the thought did they release it digitally because its awful like the other one couldnt leave my mind so i watched it with moderately low expectations fortunately this flick is one of the sweetest surprises of this year i didnt expect to shed tears in such a generic tale but i did the story follows a familiar formula from the studio but with a few twists the protagonist is the star of a declining show when someone new comes in to save the whole thing making the protagonist jealous however this time the protagonist doesnt try to sabotage anyone to be the main attraction again ivan becomes very close to ruby brooklynn prince and really wants to fulfill a heartfelt promise that he makes to stella to set everyone free mike white who cowrote one of the worst movies of alltime the emoji movie was also a reason for my low confidence levels but i can now forgive him for being part of that other animated atrocity white gives every single character a defining personality or at least a specific trait unique to that animal even side characters with no real impact in the story like henrietta chaka khan  murphy ron funches  or frankie white himself  are clearly stuck in my memory due to their hilarious bits i never imagined i would laugh to a why did the chicken cross the road joke ever again  ivan ruby stella and bob danny devito are undoubtedly the standouts all are characters so easy to fall in love with ivan works beautifully as a protagonist whose backstory is as tragic as one can imagine his arc is incredibly compelling and emotionally powerful so much that it still ends partially sad his relationship with ruby feels authentic and heartfelt just like with stella bob is definitely the funniest of them all but even he has a story of abandonment and isolation every wild animal deserves freedom and every domestic animal deserves a family home thats a message ill always stand by and fight for as an animal lover the highest praise i can offer this film is that it feels surprisingly immersive even when watching at home when ivan talked i never thought thats sam rockwell i always looked and heard ivan as ivan same with every other character the animals look impressively realistic but movie magic reached a point where i cant even tell the difference between a real animal and a fake one sometimes its not really the case of the one and only ivan but after the lion king something like the former doesnt really surprise me anymore still it just goes to show how storytelling can be the headliner i was so enthralled by the narrative that i couldnt care less about the visually stunning animals nor the excellent voice acting i just wanted to see the animals be set free finally two more impactful aspects that made the film better for me craig armstrongs score is exceptionally prone to chills and tears its subtle when it needs to be and powerfully moving when the big moments arrive one of my favorite scores of 2020 the last detail has to do with the movies inception dont ask me why but i missed the inspired by a true story at the opening credits as usual in this type of films right after these end text accompanies photos and clips in this case of the reallife ivan in an otherwise generic movie i was emotionally shocked once i saw those real images i finish the film with tears of happiness but i have to leave a disclaimer when it comes to negatives this is one of those movies where i cant really point out straightup flaws or technical issues my only nitpick is that id have loved to see more development regarding ivan and macks bryan cranston supposedly strong bond that they share as a family it doesnt detract from the touching moments between the two but it could have made those sequences much more impactful its simply a fun entertaining fastpaced onehourandahalf flick that works for both adults and children however even though theres no visible violence or animal abuse some of the animal characters share their sorrowful traumatic past which can be a tad too dark for really young kids the one and only ivan is one of the most loving surprises of 2020 boasting an impeccable cast and one of my favorite scores of the year this adaptation of ivans true story might follow a slightly changed generic formula but its undoubtedly an emotional journey worthy of everyones attention both adults and children mike white delivers a heartfelt screenplay packed with memorable animal characters easy to connect with even for viewers who arent animal lovers a beautiful story filled with meaningful messages and tearinducing moments executed so brilliantly that it became one of my most immersive home viewings of the last few years visually i cant point out a single issue the animals look incredible if i needed an argument to convince friends and family to subscribe to disney  this is the movie id show them ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog  i love scifi space movies especially when these depict the cosmos in such a visually stunning manner as ad astra does its one of those films where the visuals elevate whatever narrative is being told if you dont get goosebumps or get excited with the opening sequence of this movie then it might not be the film youre looking for from the quiet but powerful sound design to the impressive cinematography james gray delivers a visually captivating story with an outstanding protagonist brad pitt is definitely getting tons of nominations this awards season lets not forget his amazing role in once upon a time in hollywood  his subtle yet incredibly emotional performance shows an astonishing range he carries the whole screenplay in his shoulders and i dont mind that at all theres a lot of narration and heres where i transition to the most divisive aspect of the movie its a slowburn now theres no problem with a film being deliberately slow in fact some of my favorite movies of alltime arent fastpaced they cherish their story and make the audience feel interested in what theyre experiencing ad astra isnt an action flick or a comedy its a characterdriven drama so most of the runtime is devoted to developing roy that said dont go in with expectations of feeling entertained all the time some moments arent supposed to excite you or leave you jawdropped some sequences are just meant to make you feel immersed by the environment be lost in space imax is the mandatory way of watching this feature  dont expect the film to make an 80day trip to some planet end in two cuts and 20 seconds gray purposefully establishes a slow pace obviously general audiences dont usually enjoy this type of flicks but if youre able to manage your expectations realistically youre one step closer to not feel bored throughout the runtime the first act is the one that captures everyones attention it doesnt waste time on earth it goes through whats happening pretty quickly and it possesses 90 of the heavy action including one of the best opening sequences of the year  sound has a significant impact on how gray films his sequences and its unbelievable how wellshot the chasing scenes on the moon are scientifically speaking this is no interstellar where you simply have to accept some mindblowing yet unjustified stuff ad astra doesnt have a single scene where one might think this completely takes me out of the movie i cant accept that this is possible in some fictional future this is a huge compliment to a space film containing several launches lunar bases and very long space journeys however the remaining two acts focus intensely on pitts character slowing down the main plot like i wrote above theres a lot of development through roys thoughts extensive narration is almost always an issue even when the narrator is brad pitt some monologues do indeed develop the character or explain what hes feeling but some tend to fall into the philosophical side that doesnt always carry a meaningful or interesting message using everyday language sometimes its a bit boring additionally the ending might be a letdown for a lot of people tommy lee jones h clifford mcbride doesnt have a lot of screentime and i cant really delve into details about his storyline but his characters relationship with roy doesnt exactly serve as a fantastic payoff max richters score is one of 2019s best and i hope it gets recognized by every award show it definitely helps the experience to be more enthralling the lack of sound in space is also powerful in its own way beautifullyedited but with a continuously slow pace that doesnt change from the moment the second act begins however the story of ad astra is vastly superior to for example grays the lost city of z which i genuinely disliked this space adventure is visually more exciting its story is more engaging and its protagonist is more compelling than everything else in grays previous installment finally its one of those movies that watching at a film theater mainly imax or at home makes a massive difference youll never feel as entertained or captivated at home so make sure to check this one at the best possible screen near you all in all ad astra is yet another display case for brad pitts chances at winning an oscar with a subtle yet powerful performance pitt carries the whole story to safe harbor with tremendous help from the eyegasmic visuals technically its one of 2019s closest movies to being perfect very wellshot welledited with an immersive score and gorgeous cinematography however its a slowburn that doesnt always work as such narration is the goto method to develop pitts character and while it works most of the time it slows down the main plot becoming a tad boring during a few moments the ending isnt the impactful payoff that the film needed and the incredible supporting cast is underutilized in the end its still a great movie and one that should be seen at the biggest and best screen possible so go see it for yourself  ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog its not easy to start off a new cinematic universe the first installment must be an undeniable success on almost all fronts for the franchise to take off from interesting worldbuilding to delivering a good first film its a brutally challenging task for any director and writer to take on godzilla has been around forever but warner bros and legendary entertainment bravely brought on an inexperienced filmmaker gareth edwards monsters  and a debutant screenwriter max borenstein to handle yet another version of the godzilla story expectationswise i know that audiences look at this type of movie from an actionheavy perspective a massive majority of the viewers just want to see monsters fighting which is understandable i enjoy a big battle as much as any other moviegoer but i do desire a remotely decent story when it comes to this particular genre i dont ask for an oscarworthy screenplay that leaves me floored by the end of the film i dont need incredibly complex multilayered characters with exquisite motivations i dont even mind heavy exposition as long as its not overdone and sluggish with that said i also dont want the most annoying cliche archetypes nor nonsensical plot points i genuinely hate myself when i get too nitpicky with movie logic issues but when the characters make the most ridiculously absurd decisions that no sane human being would make then the film is really asking for a negative commentary borenstein  who goes on to cowrite two of the following three installments in the monsterverse  gets close to a perfectly balanced narrative which in this genre is related to the amount of screentime allocated to humans and monsters this movie cant just be godzilla fighting a random monster since the visually appealing constant battles would lose impact with time besides the lack of a story  but it also cant waste all of its duration with the human characters  after all the film is titled godzilla not the brody family audiences all over the world enter their respective theaters to be blown away by the action visuals score and be thoroughly entertained by titans punching each other to death several characters carry surprisingly compelling arcs especially ford and joe brody the fatherson relationship between aaron taylorjohnson kickass and bryan cranston breaking bad argo feels authentic with both having a common unsolved problem from their past that links to the king of the monsters the emotional attachment to this family elevates the dangerous sequences that the movie holds throughout its runtime cranston offers an undeniable commitment to his role while taylorjohnson demonstrates some of the talent that would later be discovered by marvel ken watanabe inception batman begins is a fantastic addition to the cast as dr ishiro serizawa a scientist who fortunately doesnt follow the formulaic development usually thrown at this type of character elizabeth olsen oldboy martha marcy may marlene and sally hawkins blue jasmine happygolucky also get a bit of screentime but theyre basically just people close to the important characters gareth edwards admittedly loves the godzilla lore but any viewer can tell the great care that both edwards and borenstein have with their characters more screentime is handed to humanity than to the monsters which will undoubtedly disappoint many fans while i do feel invested in the protagonists too much time is spent with the military where countless exposition scenes drag the overall narrative the suspenseful buildup to the climactic third act is efficient but the action is frustratingly hidden from the viewers most of the titanic battles are seen through the windows of a car train building or even tvs the main problem with the film isnt spending time with humans when the monsters arent fighting but choosing to remain with these characters even when godzilla and co enter the scene titans are fighting right behind the camera and they keep the audience either entirely in the dark or just partially show a section of the battle most of the shots are groundlevel usually showing the pov of a certain character while that brings a higher sense of danger and desperation to the screen it also generates a frustrating feeling in the audience whos not seeing godzilla fighting in its full splendor i understand that part of this decision might be related to some less polished vfx and in all honesty despite the rare wide shots of the monsters the action is definitely entertaining and quite riveting alexandre desplats score is vibrant and the actual monsters look gorgeous in the purposefully dark environment helps to hide visual imperfections  especially godzilla godzilla focuses more on the human characters than on the monster fights and despite the narrative balance needing some adjustments it surprisingly works quite well as the first installment in the monsterverse gareth edwards and max borenstein deliver an incredibly compelling story on the human side fully developing the main characters and handing them interesting arcs most of the runtime is spent with these protagonists which will undoubtedly disappoint some fans who crave the titanic battles but the suspenseful buildup works in favor of the climactic third act however choosing to remain with the humans when the monsters are already fighting in the background is a questionable decision that leaves an extremely frustrating feeling in the audience cast visuals and score seem to hit the right notes but the actual combat is rarely seen in its full glory  most of it is shown through a groundlevel characters perspective  partially due to the necessity of hiding some vfx imperfections still its an utterly enjoyable monster flick that sets up a pretty entertaining cinematic universe  ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog if youre reading this then you probably visited my review of 2018s a quiet place hence you know how much i absolutely love that movie a lowbudget highconcept horror flick that surprised everyone including myself ultimately becoming one of the very best films of the respective year as well as one of the best original horror stories in the last couple of decades now i acknowledge that john krasinski created something that could very well turn out to be the next big thing when it comes to horror franchises however that doesnt mean i support that endeavor artistically i would much rather prefer for this to be a oneoff but i know better than anyone that if an original movie is tremendously successful at the box office  especially one that requires a short amount of money to make  sequel talks will obviously emerge my only major issue with the first film was in fact its ending its an admittedly badass conclusion but it also felt like a cry to hollywood in order to extend the story i didnt expect this type of ending for such a characterdriven personal project but in all honesty i rather have a sequel to a quiet place than the 10th saw film or the continuation of the neverending fast furious saga with that said my expectations were still pretty high due to krasinskis even more impactful involvement in the movie with sole screenwriting credit and only possessing a few minutes of screentime this time around krasinski gets more time to focus on his primary technical role delivering once again a masterfully directed film i find a quiet place part ii inferior to its predecessor in many ways but the extreme levels of suspense generated by krasinskis flawless direction are still the highlight of this saga the beautifully shot opening sequence cinematography by polly morgan sets up the incredibly high level of tension for the subsequent monster scenes all requiring the viewers to hold their breath for several minutes these nervewracking moments are elevated by terrific acting performances across the board  ill get there  but krasinski demonstrates exquisite knowledge of the art of filmmaking using his best attributes in favor of the movie boasting a nailbiting atmosphere and effective jumpscares the characters find a few imaginative evasion maneuvers to avoid the monsters however this leads me to one of my main issues with this sequel the first film establishes the creatures in its ruthless merciless first few minutes where it becomes clear that if someone makes the tiniest noise and if a monster is nearby theyre dead theres a minimal chance of survival and the emotionally resonant ending also attests to this fundamental lethal aspect of the whole soundhunting beasts concept nevertheless during the entire runtime of the sequel including the phenomenal opening its like were witnessing different monsters if the first movie already had a couple of logicrelated issues this sequel increases the number of personal nitpicks people can run away quite a bit before the creatures get close  so much that i firmly believed the film would go back to the opening sequence to explain how the main characters managed to escape a specific attack protagonists survive absurdly improbable situations due to heavy plot armor even a couple of character plot decisions are questionable to say the least particularly the trigger that sets up the third act after the first movie where everything feels surprisingly grounded and far from nonsensical jumping to the continuation of the same story and having to disconnect our brain continuously is a bit disappointing especially since the screenplay remains incredibly focused on the characters almost every element in this film feels less emotionally impactful than the original but its far from being a massive letdown in fact having in mind the competition in the genre a quiet place part ii might even be one of the best horror sequels ever for all i know firstly the actors are absolutely magnificent emily blunt evelyn and cillian murphy  who i didnt expect to have that much importance and screentime as he has  bring their experience to a movie where the young actors are the ones who truly shine noah jupe marcus and millicent simmonds regan steal the spotlight from the more renowned colleagues delivering impressive performances that will surely guarantee them several award nominations by the end of the year the focus on deeply exploring the characters strengthens the emotional connection with the viewers making every scene carry a certain gravitas ethical dilemmas are beautifully tackled through murphys character emmett who creates an unexpected bond with regan the latter stands out as a brave smart altruist deaf girl who should inspire many people worldwide  its worth remembering that simmonds a reallife deaf girl brings outstanding authenticity to her role just like the original film most dialogues contain sign language so the narrative is also developed through visual storytelling once again krasinski knows perfectly when and how to tell the audience something exclusively through the camera many times just pure silence keeping the viewers attention on the screen at all times throughout the sequel there are various visual nods and callbacks to the first flick that i also appreciated quite a lot such as a certain object on a shelf or a repeated sentence the ending carries less emotional weight than the originals brutal final minutes but the entire last act will go down as one of the most impeccably edited conclusions of the year michael p shawver needs to crosscut between excruciatingly tense sequences on completely different locations with important characters facing the same level of danger the action is displayed seamlessly letting the viewers genuinely enjoy the last moments of the movie without annoyingly choppy editing marco beltramis score is really gripping during the entirety of these last few scenes a quiet place part ii feels less than its predecessor in almost every element but its still one of the best sequels of the genre from the riveting frenetic opening sequence  much of it shot in long uncut takes  to one of the most impressively edited endings ive seen in years john krasinski maintains an incredibly tense suspenseful atmosphere throughout the entire runtime something thats becoming a trademark of his directing career storywise the characters continue to be the main focus of the narrative boasting emotional dilemmas and bold character development the kids have a surprising impact on the overall screenplay cillian murphy and emily blunt are remarkable but noah jupe and millicent simmonds are astonishing especially the latter however the monsters are depicted in a much less threatening lethal manner leading to many questionable plot decisions as well as absurd survival situations in addition to this the worldbuilding lacks significant revelations and creative ideas overall its a less emotionally resonant film than the original which doesnt exactly let me down but i did expect more from this sequel still i highly recommend watching it at the theater after all both audience and critics are enjoying this movie tremendously ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog i dont even know how to start this review marriage story is one of those movies that stays with me long after ive finished it ive been thinking about it a lot and its undoubtedly one of the most realistic dramas ive ever seen thats due to the awardworthy performances of adam driver charlie barber and scarlett johansson nicole barber  but also because of noah baumbachs incredibly layered screenplay in addition to this baumbach is undeniably one of the best directors of the year with the help of his dp robbie ryan he sets the platform for driver and johansson to shine as the astonishing actors that they are some people watch films to forget their daily issues some just want to have fun some want to learn more about a particular true story however theres not a single person alive who wants to watch a movie and not be able to leave the theater or in this case their couch entertained marriage story has such an emotionally complicated premise that its tough to convince people to sit and watch i mean who wants to watch a divorce develop throughout more than two hours who wants to watch two people who were once in love with each other become the worst of themselves yelling fighting court custody lawyers its not exactly an attentiongrabber i imagine people who went through the same situation getting triggered and remember a phase of their lives that was probably one of their worst im writing this because ive seen some negativity towards people who simply dont want to watch baumbachs depiction of a depressing event its perfectly understandable if anyone decides to skip this one especially if it hits too close to home in my case ive never gone through a divorce hopefully ill never will  and usually i can enjoy this type of sad frustrating bittersweet films manchester by the sea a ghost story for what they are no matter how tragic if i had to choose oneword praise realistic theres no way around it the palpable emotions are the main reason why this story works so well only people who have never been in a relationship of any kind cant understand the moment when a fight starts to escalate and the couple begins to say terrible stuff at each other that they dont exactly mean the exaggeration and overthetop arguments are part of every couples life they can occur due to a hundred reasons related to stress work accumulation of little things or simply because its just not a good day marriage story doesnt deliver a hopeful message or a sweet story because thats not what divorces are its not difficult to imagine how hard it is to separate yourself from the person you love d for years without end even more when theres a kid involved in the process baumbach could have followed the genre cliches and provide moments of pure happiness but thats not something that happens during a situation like this its a heartwrenching phase to live through and i believe that this movie is going to be thoroughly analyzed in film school in the next decade or so the scene with driver and johansson going at each other exponentially harder and heavier criticismwise is one of the most emotionally powerful dialogues of the millennium the raw emotion and the physical movements that both actors can bring into the fight are absurdly impressive their chemistry is so inexplicably real i never not even for a single second thought that i was watching fictional characters nicole and charlie can very well be our neighbors or part of our family baumbachs use of long takes really elevate every single sequence allowing the protagonists to move around the set and actually act technically theres no better acting this year than what driver and johansson deliver both are always moving and doing a lot of things while giving their lines making dinner drinking tea going to the bathroom chopping a carrot blowing their nose standing up sitting down walking around the room crying smiling laughing all of this in a single take several times scarlett shows more emotion throughout the runtime than her counterpart but adam proves why hes the frontrunner at the 2019s oscars his restraint when charlie is trying to be polite even though hes mad or his explosive behavior when his character decides to finally let go excellent buildup  are some of the attributes that make his performance my favorite of the year not trying to diminish johanssons display both deliver careerbest performances in my opinion both deserve every award that exists the supporting cast is also impeccable and i know that laura dern nora fanshaw is probably going to be nominated still the two leads are so engaging and captivating that i couldnt be impressed with anyone else the only person to rise to the main actors level is noah baumbach himself with the best screenplay of 2019 he offers the audience an incredibly complex story filled with subtle details and exceptional dialogue he controls the movies pacing beautifully and he knows the right moments to insert a little joke to lighten up the dark depressing mood my only issue with the film has to do with its replay value we all have been through this situation watching a fantastic movie only once and never again marriage story is going to be one of those films for me i love everything about it but i know the chances of a rewatch are very very small its a profoundly unsettling story super uncomfortable at times and i really dont want to go through the sadness and frustration all over again all in all noah baumbach delivers what i believe to be its careerbest flick marriage story with the best screenplay of 2019 as well as one the best directions this is the closest the world is ever going to get to a realistic depiction of a divorce scarlett johansson and adam driver also give the best performances of their lives elevating every single scene dialogue argument or joke the long takes allow them to shine and actually work as actors moving around the set and doing domestic job tasks while delivering their lines technically both baumbach and the entire cast are absolutely perfect its an extremely emotional narrative very depressing sad and even uncomfortable at times which might scare some people off especially if theyve been through this despite its replay value being affected a rewatch is very unlikely  its a phenomenal lesson in storytelling that stays with us long after its finished easily one of the best movies of 2019 dont miss it and try not to cry ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog  honestly im going straight to the point and im going to try not to waste anyones time since thats precisely what dark phoenix did clearly no one in the production team cared about this movie now after watching the film its pretty easy to understand the reasons behind the constant delays and the poor marketing campaign i barely saw anything remotely publicizing this movie  its not a complete disaster its not an absolute mess but the third act is such a stab into the fans hearts literally one of the most abrupt endings of the last few years it really feels like a producer entered the writers room and said something along the lines of lets just hurry this up marvel cinematic universe is right around the corner nothing of what we do here matters im not going to lie its actually true no matter how amazing or horrible this film ended up to be it wouldnt really matter which is probably the most negative aspect of this disneyfox merger days of future past is arguably one of the better xmen installments but apocalypse and dark phoenix feel such a waste of time because they never really explore what the timetravel event really changed and now times up a complete reboot is coming the first act of this movie is genuinely remarkable i felt invested in both the story and characters i was deeply captivated by what they were doing and hans zimmers score elevates a specific sequence that on imax really shows off both the visual and audios phenomenal quality until midway through its a pretty wellwritten wellperformed and exciting film with occasional minor issues  however after a risky yet convincing plot point simon kinberg annihilates everything he was working on until then from this moment on i can feel the famous merger being signed and everyone working on this movie just giving up the writing becomes atrocious one of the most forgettable and nonsensical villains ever shows up and i thought that comicbook adaptations were working past the cliche bad guys  characters like quiksilver are barely in the film why set up his relationship with his father if they never approach that subplot again  and the ending lasts around three minutes three in this amount of time they do the equivalent of the last hour of avengers endgame now try to imagine that epic hour of climactic battles crushed into a couple of minutes the cast truly tries sophie turner carries this movie with such an emotionally powerful performance that i almost feel that she alone deserved a positive review james mcavoy professor charles xavier continues his streak of gripping displays if he doesnt get a freaking oscar in the next years ill explode  michael fassbender is splendid as magneto and jennifer lawrence mystique doesnt do much nicholas hoult beast is a pleasant surprise but jessica chastain smith is the only one at fault here i never felt any interest from the actress in getting into a superhero film and honestly it shows shes definitely the one that couldnt care less about what comes out of this so she just offers a onedimensional performance for a pretty lousy villain the screenplay is filled with characters making uncharacteristic decisions they feel unearned  and exposition scenes that dont really do justice to the compelling backstories nevertheless i always feel the need to come back to the ending i rather have a slow start but a strong finish than the other way around dark phoenix delivers a fastpaced entertaining and captivating first act but slowly starts to degrade until it culminates with one of the sagas worst third acts sure the action is great and its quite wellfilmed actually but it all ends so quickly that you dont have enough time even to try to enjoy it if it wasnt for hans zimmers score which completely nailed me to the screen my brain would have shut itself down before the wrapup its a shame that such a beloved franchise like the xmen has to end like this simon kinberg knowing that the merger was going to happen should have changed the last half and risk a lot more to be honest if the movie really didnt matter then they should have tried to do something that was never done before and go allout if it fails it fails but at least it would have been remembered as a courageous and powerful film this way not only its a disappointing culmination to a 20year saga but its forgettable its not even horrible enough for people to remember how bad it was its just  meh if they didnt care how can they ask the audience to do it for them all in all dark phoenix ends up being what everyone feared it would be a movie that didnt matter at all one that didnt even try to pay homage to an extraordinary saga that notably influenced the comicbook genre the worst of all is that everyone can imagine how great it could have been since the cast is perfect sophie turner shines  hans zimmers score is sumptuous and the action is riveting the worst feeling that a fan can have is that disappointment with how the film turned out to be mixed with the frustration due to how well a fan can imagine how amazing it could have been however a flawed narrative with a terrible villain and questionable character decisions ruins those dreams with one of the most abrupt endings of the last years xmen reaches its end as an isolated franchise and it now rests its hopes on kevin feige and marvel co that the mcu will do the mutants justice ps as you know i try to avoid trailers as much as i can after watching dark phoenixs ones i can only advise you to not watch a single one not even the first one especially that first one i cant understand how someone approves trailers so spoilery as these ones unbelievable ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog  usually i leave the technical aspects to the end of my reviews since story characters and the critical element of each genre action in action flicks comedy in comedies and so on are way more important however having in mind the whole marketing campaign surrounding gemini mans groundbreaking innovations ill address them now even after sleeping on it my experience in high frame rate still feels very weird in case you need some explaining hfr adds a lot more detail to the image since it captures more frames per second hence making the image smoother which can be extremely distracting i always disable motion smoothing on my tv since i hate that feeling of knowing that somethings not right it doesnt have to do with speed which is something people are going to wrongly state regarding this film the action isnt faster dont make the mistake of saying this since theres 25x more detail 24 fps is the standard frame rate  movements become easier to follow so theres the illusion of watching something faster than normal truth is it just feels like it when characters are just talking and theres no action involved it works because it simply looks better however the action sequences are very hitandmiss some pieces look absolutely amazing but its clear this technology needs a few more years of experience to reach its full potential scenes featuring car motorbike chases running or shootings are stunningly filmed but any handtohand combat is frustratingly offputting additionally ang lee applies an excessive use of cgi to a lot of these moments which makes some fights look incredibly absurd hfr is not the only technical attribute people are going to discuss that young version of will smith honestly it doesnt really work for me people who complained about the lion king 2019 not being able to show animals emoting will surely hate this attempt of replicating a young will smith if they dont then joker was right society is indeed extremely hypocritical  its just like the action sequences with hfr hitandmiss there are some genuinely mindblowing scenes with medium shots of young will smith and he looks 999 real in these specific shots its impossible to tell the difference between the clone and a real version however it still fails to deliver this realism throughout the entire runtime first of all young henry barely shows any emotions except a brilliant crying moment  which is obviously meant to facilitate the vfx teams work but even with his face completely still and empty of emotions the eyes just look too dolllike the eyebrows move strangely and the forehead seems odd in the end it all comes down to forgetting that its a digital character and that almost never happens i always felt like i was watching a blend of cgi motioncapture and whatever other technology they used to try to pull this off in a few years from now if gemini man gets a remake or some other movie tries to do something similar i bet it will look nearperfect right now its more of a disturbance than an achievement put this together with the already notthatgood hfr and we get a visually striking yet distracting film and if you thought the story would save it its pretty bad generic predictable and filled with almost offensive exposition i would have to go through my reviews but this is definitely one of the most expositionheavy screenplays of the year i lost count of the number of times a character starts ranting with the purpose of explaining something evident to another character the worst thing a screenplay can do is treat the audience like they are 5yearold children the whole plot revolves around people asking someone else what happened whats happening and whats next we already know from the trailer will smith is being hunted by a young version of himself a clone try to imagine how many ways you can tell someone theres an individual exactly like that person now just lazily insert all of those sentences on a characters script and make it say them in a single scene im sorry but its laughably bad there are no surprises it ends abruptly utterly disregarding the only interesting plot point still very predictable  by not developing it any further than one sequence if it wasnt for the truly fantastic cast will smith is always impeccable mary elizabeth winstead and benedict wong deliver great performances  gemini man would easily be one of the absolute worst movies of the year shoutout to lorne balfes score which is by far the technical aspect worthy of only compliments all in all ang lees attempt to deliver a groundbreaking film doesnt quite hit the mark honestly its still far from it the 60 fps hfr and the young version of will smith are occasionally jawdropping but both technical aspects need years of improvement to be able to work seamlessly as of now these only serve as a frustrating distraction however the biggest problem with gemini man is its expositionheavy screenplay which besides treating the audience like dumb people doesnt carry any sort of surprise or novelty as generic and predictable as it could be the unbelievably talented cast a spectacular score from lorne balfe and a few notable action sequences save this technological hitandmiss from missing its target entirely ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog i always struggle to find reasons to dislike a pixar film one of the most annoying preconceived notions about genres is the one about animated movies theyre for children how can you enjoy stuff like that youre so childish people say little do they know that animated flicks have as much or more emotionally compelling narratives and characters than liveaction films the score is usually more important in the former genre and the visuals always look stunning the partnership disneypixar is probably the best thing that could have happened to hollywood dan scanlon delivered a surprisingly good sequel to monsters inc back in 2013 with monsters university making an efficient sequel twelve years after its original is a challenging task and scanlon succeed so i had good expectations going in onward might not be one of pixars best movies and i doubt that a lot of people will place it as one of their favorites when comparing with the studios films of the same type however it still carries the trademark emotional narrative with relatable characters that pixar always delivers i grew up with a father mother and two older brothers just with this information i know that im luckier than a whole bunch of people all around the world onward focuses on the relationship between two siblings chris pratt and tom holland  and i love their adventure together it made me recall my childhood and the awesome moments i shared with my brothers if youre a fan of dungeons dragons or other questbased games the main plots structure will definitely please you as it did me but its connected to my biggest gripe the concept is pretty neat but its execution lacks a little bit of more magic as ironic as it might be for example frozen ii isnt about a world full of magic but elsa idina menzel alone has more magical scenes than onward in its entirety in the former the actual magic feels the screen with stunning animation and chillinducing music onward feels like a diminished version of its true potential while its true that the world where the main characters live in has lost its overwhelming magic from the past their adventure is filled with obstacles which they deal with you guessed it magic i dont want to sound like that guy who only wants action for the sake of action i hate when people dislike a movie simply because they didnt see enough stuff exploding or something its a bit about expectations and about what i know pixar can do obviously im expecting more from them now more than ever its not that the story isnt interesting or captivating because theres definitely an entertaining vibe throughout the whole runtime its wellpaced theres always something going on and the humor is pitchperfect its good simple as that the voice acting is fantastic tom holland and especially chris pratt really incorporate their characters spirit and its almost palpable that the actors had tons of fun behindthescenes julia louisdreyfus and octavia spencer are also quite good but their characters respective arcs arent near as compelling as the primary narrative every moment i spent with them is every moment i wanted to go back to the brothers however the fun and entertainment never go away the story never fails to be exciting it just goes increases and decreases its level ever so slightly i saved the best for last even though the second act feels a tad repetitive the ending is incredibly satisfying predictable yes will it be underwhelming disappointing for some people surely but it delivers the most beautiful of messages in the most emotional way possible as pixar always manages to do a lot of nice small morals are learned throughout the story but the final one is absolutely perfect and it left some tears in my eyes the ending is heartfelt and genuine for everyone but it will have a tremendous impact on families that lost a member way too soon all in all the disneypixars partnership continues to provide the world with the best animated films of each year onward is the most recent success even though it lacks a bit of magic and creativity when compared to the studios movies of the same genre boasting a talented voice cast the two brothers go on a fun questbased adventure that concludes with a wonderful heartfelt message to every family out there some people might find the ending too predictable and underwhelming but the climax is emotionally powerful and it will unquestionably cause an impact on everyone tissues anyone  its second act feels a bit repetitive but the entertainment never fades away hilarious and clever humor compelling main characters notthatinteresting secondary characters and gorgeous animation as always the end credits song is pretty cool too cant wait for soul  ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog  im going to write it straight away i didnt enjoy pok mon detective pikachu as much as i wanted to in some ways it disappointed me now youre probably thinking oh hes one of those people who never saw or played pok mon in his life and now hes going to destroy the film because he never understood it not even close there are always three groups of people when it comes to these famous franchises that have massive fandoms the hardcore fans who follow the respective saga since it was created and never once stopped supporting it the fans who like or even love it but either skipped or gave up at a certain point in time the nonfans who never really got into it and dont relate to any of what the previous two groups do i belong to the second group im a fan of pok mon but since the end of the last decade that i stopped playing its video games and watching any series or movies about it nevertheless im always as fair and impartial as possible to films and to the people who gave their all to deliver a great story for hardcore fans this movie might have everything youve ever wished for even i was able to understand that some scenes are filled and i mean literally the whole screen with references and easter eggs that the most dedicated fans will absolutely love these moments alone can make you enjoy this film way more than fans like me however we all know that while these sequences look fantastic and offer a lot of excitement they are not enough to hold a narrative together or make it captivating the pok mons are gorgeous and i found myself constantly in awe liveaction will always have that crowd of haters that think the animated versions should stay animated no matter what there will always be people hating on these type of movies solely by the fact that theyre liveaction honestly i try very hard but i cant understand how people find an incredibly realistic pikachu ugly or disgusting when it looks absolutely adorable and visually impressive this will be such a long and exhausting debate throughout the 2020s every time a liveaction remake or adaptation is released but i have faith people will come to accept it or even love it eventually detective pikachu main issues are the screenplay and most of the characters no doubt about it i understand that the production team had to shift the primary focus to the vfx regarding the actual pok mons since a lot of the viewers will buy the ticket only to watch a beautiful real world filled with them but the two pillars of any film should never be kept aside for too long story and characters justice smith portrays the only human character that has a compelling backstory and a likable personality yes kathryn newton lucy stevens delivers a good performance and she also might interpret a character that a lot of people can relate to but from the moment lucy has more to do in the movie its like her development stagnated however smith is brilliant as tim and he showed a great range of emotions making me not only laugh but also feel a bit emotional sadly these two are the only human characters that arent either a cliche villain who wants to rule the world or a paperthin police or scientist who only serve as exposition devices honestly this might be one of the most expositiondriven films of 2019 the amount of cheap and lazy information dumps spread across the runtime is too much to handle especially when the same info is repeated several times it unbalances the pacing and even the tone of the movie making it dull during some periods im rarely the guy who wants more action but detective pikachu really needed more thrilling moments preferably involving pok mon of the few action sequences most are just our protagonists running from something and jumping from cliffs very rarely we see actual pok mons doing anything until the last act rob letterman shows that he has a lot of great qualities that a director should have but he needs to work on his flaws and leave the screenwriting role to more experienced people for such a mysterydriven story the mystery part is pretty evident from the getgo with a notable exception at the very end that i didnt saw coming and ended the film on a high note pikachu is beautifully voiced by ryan reynolds and if you were worried that his voice wouldnt blend with the yellow fellow dont be pikachu is extremely funny and charming carrying the whole show on its shoulders with a little help of psyduck cubone and ditto also have some great moments but mewtwo is a beauty to behold as expected even though im not a hardcore fan i felt the immersiveness of the incredible pok mon world that warner bros built and thats the best compliment i can give i felt like i was in a real pok mon universe all in all pok mon detective pikachu is fine for hardcore fans it might be everything youve ever wished for but for fans of the 2000s pok mon who stopped following the franchise after the beginning of the new decade the numerous easter eggs and references might not be enough to overcome the undeniable narrative issues justice smith delivers an outstanding performance and ryan reynolds nails pikachus voice being extremely funny and unbelievably adorable the cgi is groundbreaking making the pok mons astonishingly realistic and their world remarkably immersive however even if the movie ends with a terrific touch the shallow characters the heavy exposition dumps and the notthatmysterious mystery bring the pacing down and turn this liveaction adaptation into just an okay one ps regarding the curse of the video games cinematic adaptations i already believe that tomb raider broke it with a good margin but both warcraft and pok mon detective pikachu managed to just scratch the positive side of my reviews youre on the right track but step up hollywood ",

really have a big name attached to it even though i actually enjoy some of kristen stewarts performances who like robert pattinson has a few blind haters that havent seen anything else other than twilight  as well as a few other actors jessica henwick particularly  then no director or screenwriter caught my attention william eubank hasnt done anything exceptional yet brian duffield cowrote insurgent awful but delivered a surprisingly fun horror screenplay with the babysitter finally adam cozad helped to create some underwhelming narratives the legend of tarzan jack ryan shadow recruit  in addition to this im not in favor of films written by more than two people since these usually disappoint and its a january movie so why was i slightly excited to watch underwater for the same reason a lot of people probably avoided it its formulaic horrorthriller story deep at the bottom of the ocean if a scifi film has a premise based on a team that works on a claustrophobic location and some sort of entity disrupts their job im instantly drawn into these movies theres something about them that makes me enjoy them more than most people usually this type of film has a lowbudget and really requires a talented director whos able to generate genuine tension and suspense underwater is 2020s big surprise january movies are known to be hollywoods trash bin so im honestly dumbfounded that this film is far from being bad its very very good the set and production design are impressive and they help create that isolated suspenseful atmosphere the first few minutes are nailbiting the next twenty minutes are fantastic the following twenty minutes continue to be a blast of entertainment i felt continuously surprised by how good the movie actually is i still cant believe what i just witnessed dont twist my words its not a masterpiece or even a great film it still follows a plotdriven narrative that countless other movies did better it borrows inspiration from alien cloverfield 20000 leagues under the sea and every other film involving an alienlike form threatening a crew plus it lacks characterization of pretty much every character theres no real attempt at deeply developing a single character to make the audience care about it but this doesnt mean the movie cant succeed like i wrote above theres a whole lot of plotdriven films that went on to be phenomenal the difference between those and underwater is that the latter doesnt truly bring anything new to the genre it just uses the known cliches and executes them really well which is itself a massive surprise i cant deny that i had a lot of fun watching this thriller i expected messy action with way too dark lighting making it impossible to see anything i received surprisingly visible wellfilmed sequences packed with tension tons of panic and a palpable sense of urgency there arent that many moments to breathe and relax the vfx team and bojan bazelli cinematographer deserve a lot of credit because the aliens not only are visually captivating but they are shown just in the right spots for the exact right amount of time underwater doesnt possess a huge budget so the creatures need to be shown in the shadows to make them look and feel realistic it might seem like an obvious technical decision to be made but its execution its far from being an easy task so kudos to everyone that participated in making the monsters a genuinely menacing threat the cast is excellent kristen stewart continues to break out of the twilight shell proving again and again that shes a wonderful actress jessica henwick is pretty great as well as vincent cassel everyone delivers fairly decent performances even tj miller who portrays the always divisive comicrelief character that will surely be extremely annoying to some and quite funny to others i stand in the middle i think his character is fine  its definitely a good scifi horrorthriller way better than most january flicks underwater is one of the last 20th century foxs movies which probably means that disney had no clue what to do with it hence dumping it in the worst month of the year  i just added william eubank to my list of directors to follow his commitment to actually make a good film is demonstrated on screen so i really hope that his movie gains some sort of following when it reaches peoples homes underwater is 2020s first massively positive surprise a january film far better than most of the months competition william eubank delivers a remarkably wellfilmed scifi horrorthriller filled with great tension surprisingly visible  action fantastic production design and some really captivating vfx work its by no means a brilliant movie it takes inspiration from better films of the same genre and it follows a straightforward plotdriven narrative with close to zero character development it simply uses the known cliches but executes them really well an underrated cast led by kristen stewart offers some notable performances but its the claustrophobic atmosphere surrounded by incredibly wellgenerated suspense that turns this movie into a success technically i still cant believe how surprised i am i just wish that it had a little bit of more characterization so i could recommend it even more as it stands do watch it at the highest quality when you get the chance ",

movie was based on a supposedly true story or in some sort of book and i knew that this could very well be an oscarbait due to the talented cast and late date of release thats it i had no idea about its political background nor vances personal statements im from portugal so i dont live in a republicans vs democrats or a red vs blue country politics is and always will be an extremely irrelevant depressing unimpactful topic in my life i dont live in the usa so unless the controversies surrounding films are global problems i couldnt care less about them to me hillbilly elegy looked like another family melodrama featuring lousy parenting drug addiction bullying discrimination and all those formulaic plot points developed in this type of movie expectationswise i couldnt avoid the first tremendously negative reactions from fellow critics on social media so i prepared myself for the worst however theres a reason why i wrote this prologue above explaining my origins and what i consider to be important in my personal life not trying to justify other peoples opinions everyone has their own right to love hate any film for whatever reasons they choose to  but it feels awfully clear to me that a lot of american critics were influenced by the reallife jd vance his memoir and what some people interpreted about his point of view i repeat everyone is in their own right to hate this movie it has more than enough reasons to and ill get to those  but i find the worst film of the year statement as exaggerated as the movies overdramatic sequences my biggest issues with hillbilly elegy concern its editing choices and its looping narrative structure besides its generic developments of known cliches starting with the first problem ron howard solo a star wars story should have managed to create a really great film from the original story at its best hillbilly elegy could have been a heartbreaking account about the emotional struggles of living in such a violent problematic family and about trying to escape this harsh lifestyle and reaching a better life overall however the constant flashbacks to jds young life damage the viewers connection to the character and the rest of his family members especially his mom bev the nonstop backandforward in the timeline breaks the movies pacing james d wilcoxs editing lacks consistency and coherence and leads me to my next issue the entire film is a cycle of dramatic scenes quickly escalating to unbelievable actions from the repetitive drug abuse and consequent relapses to the horrible parenting displayed in the most random of fashions in one minute everythings fine in the next one chaos ensues  vanessa taylor couldnt break her screenplay loop and ron howard failed to realize these sequences in a distinguished manner in addition to all of this hillbilly elegy also does very little to avoid the common formulas regarding this type of narrative possessing zero surprises throughout the entire runtime ultimately being entirely predictable practically from the beginning nevertheless as i mentioned before this is far from being a contender for the worst piece of cinema in 2020 in fact it might even get some nominations in the awards season including the oscars as usual with reallife stories their cinematic adaptations always fill the end credits with images or videos of the real people portrayed in the movie its easy to notice the impressive work made by the makeup department glenn close looks incredibly similar to the real mamaw and her charismatic portrayal is definitely getting her some nominations at least in other ceremonies besides the main ones she delivers yet another emotionally compelling performance packed with powerfully handled dialogues detailed expressiveness and a phenomenal physical display amy adams justice league doesnt fall behind if glenn close has chances as a supporting role amy adams might receive a few best actress nominations her character bev doesnt receive a fair treatment scriptwise but adams tries her best to compensate for that flaw her performance might be considered extremely overthetop for many viewers and i do acknowledge some exaggeration in a couple of scenes but overall she delivers a superb interpretation gabriel basso is also pretty great as jd as is owen asztalos  same for haley bennett the devil all the time as lindsay hans zimmer and david flemings score is sweet but it doesnt get too many moments to shine in the end hillbilly elegy suffers from its formulaic narrative stuck in a tiresome loop of overdramatic scenes that escalated incomprehensibly way too fast the predictable melodrama features questionable editing decisions that hurt the films pacing and overall story consistency as well as the viewers emotional bond with the characters ron howard and vanessa taylor fail to depict an interesting premise in a distinctly captivating manner consequently resorting to the awardworthy performances of amy adams and glenn close to save the whole movie from total disaster in addition to the outstanding displays from the two actresses the remarkable performances from the remaining cast elevate the flawed screenplay ultimately delivering a few scenes worth hanging on to technically impressively accurate makeup guaranteed awards buzz and a lovely score deserve a much better film i

path to foreign films last year martin scorseses epic the irishman could only come to life via streaming since no major studio wanted a threeandahalfhour runtime for a theater release between these two dozens of other indie flicks got netflixs or other streaming networks support 2020 brings us a spanish horrorthriller from a firsttime director galder gazteluurrutia  the platform or el hoyo  since its showing at tiff this movie has been receiving overwhelmingly positive feedback so obviously i needed to add it to my list i watched it a couple of days ago and i wanted to take time to think about it because its definitely going to become a divisive film especially among general audiences the platform carries an extremely abstract narrative filled with symbolism metaphors analogies and allegories to our politicalsocialeconomic situation its not a straightforward thriller at all its a tremendously intriguing concept developed through captivating storytelling and a very dark tone its a prison that resembles our society of today filled with hypocrisy and selfishness one month youre the king of the world on a level where food comes in excess but you still want it all for yourself ignoring desperate requests from down below as soon as in the next day youre a miserable human being fighting for scraps with your cellmate and on the exact same position those desperate people were before and now you want their help that last narrative analogy to the real world is undoubtedly my favorite i was never a fan of politics who is  so analogies and symbolism regarding that part of our life dont really impact me however its clear that the screenwriters put a lot of effort into making such a meaningful story if the ambiguousness is removed from the screenplay theres still plenty to enjoy gorengs arc goes from just trying to get a diploma to actually save the people from lower levels his story takes the viewer through tons of violence blood gore and genuinely disgusting sequences therefore people who want straightup popcornaction instead of a more philosophical take as the filmmakers intended theres a lot to be entertained by the platform is also another proof that you dont need a massive budget to build an immersive atmosphere the set and production design are as simple as they could be but its especially due to that simplicity that the claustrophobic prison works so well for a directorial debut galder gazteluurrutia does an excellent job of controlling the pacing and applying the right shots to each situation unfortunately my main issue is the same as most people the ending i will restrain myself from giving away any minor spoilers so ill just write that it doesnt work at all levels at least not for me as expected its as ambiguous as the rest of the movie as soon as i finished the film i was frustrated by so many unanswered logical questions and after a couple of days of thinking about it these questions still exist youll never find an answer to everything but that was never the main goal there has to be a balance between reality and fiction between whats real and whats just a metaphoric symbol no one can justify everything with oh its just a representation of something else for me there are two ways of interpreting the ending i could either take everything literally which would raise tons of questions without an answer or i could try and solely look at the story through gorengs perspective i do believe the latter approach is the best one even if it still carries other issues regarding secondary characters it doesnt answer everything but its the perspective i find to make more sense with the movie it makes the screenplay more cohesive and congruent nevertheless the problem i cant seem to avoid is the abrupt break in tone for such a brutal raw bloody display of human behavior in a situation of survival the way colors are used is very clever  the climax feels detached from everything that comes before the underlying themes are there from the getgo but these are precisely what they are secondary messages lying under a pretty real story going from horrible murders sacrifices and god knows what else to such a philosophical soulful ending in the way the film does its far from a seamless transition basically if you go in expecting definite answers about whatever this prison is who controls it and how it truly works youll probably leave disappointed and frustrated its one of those movies that heavily relies on how people perceive its ending and how much impact does it cause on an overall opinion looking at the conclusion solely from gorengs perspective works the best for me even if some unanswered logical questions still exist the abrupt break in tone transitioning to the films climax is my main problem but the platform has plenty of positives an extremely intriguing premise is developed through remarkably captivating storytelling and an exceptional cast elevates the wellwritten screenplay firsttime director galder gazteluurrutia and his team do an excellent job set and production design prove how a small budget can still create an immersive claustrophobic atmosphere even if the ending only works partially the symbolism and allegories of our worlds politics and socialeconomic situation are a brilliant thoughtprovoking piece of a screenplay i like more it the more i think about it  ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog here we go with the fourth review of a david finchers film this week in preparation for the upcoming mank directed by the same person who delivered phenomenal movies like se7en fight club zodiac and more now its time for the social network which premise can be summed up in the story behind the creation of facebook ten years have passed since its release and the real mark zuckerberg already stated that most of the film is based on fictional events and conversations truth is this movie was never marketed as a true story but yes as an adaptation of ben mezrichs 2009 book the accidental billionaires its a film like any other not a detailed account of whatever happened in real life with that said this is easily one of the best adapted screenplays of alltime aaron sorkin the man behind one of the best movies of 2020 the trial of the chicago 7  demonstrates his incredibly talented writing skills in the social network proving that hes one of the most meticulous writers working today if youve been reading my previous reviews theres a couple of compliments i keep giving to fincher which are his extreme attention to detail and his impressive dedication to the narrative he wants to tell so what happens when you put together two of the most perfectionist filmmakers ever an awardworthy best of the year contender arises from their gifted minds theres not even much to discuss besides the narrative itself since this is by far the aspect that elevates the whole film jeff cronenweth who previously worked in fight club brings out finchers trademark realistic look and feel through his simple yet powerful cinematography trent reznor and atticus ross original score is packed with little effects that resemble computer sounds making it quite addictive while also increasing the movies energy in the most exciting sequences finally just like in zodiac the editing work angus wall kirk baxter is absolutely seamless and its definitely the technical component that better helps sorkins screenplay shine due to the latters structure throughout the entire runtime the story is told through a nonlinear timeline mixing up facebooks actual creation ideas planning programming with the future legal issues that mark zuckerberg faces this structure allows for an exceptionally captivating and tremendously entertaining couple of hours by never letting the pacing slow down or to have an uneventful sequence the protagonist is accused of stealing the concept from the winklevoss twins both interpreted by armie hammer  gets in trouble with his best friend eduardo saverin andrew garfield  over the websites monetization and sean parker justin timberlake is partially the trigger for a lot of the chaos that ends up overwhelming zuckerbergs life sorkin and finchers greatest accomplishment is their success in making the viewer feel invested in a main character whos an utter asshole an adjective with a lot of weight in the film jesse eisenberg is remarkable as one of those characters people love to hate no wonder the real zuckerberg didnt enjoy the movie since hes depicted as a contemptible friend  eisenberg has a unique manner of speaking and distinctive mannerisms that are perfect for this character garfield and timberlake are also formidable incorporating their characters effortlessly once again comparing with zodiac the social network is also a dialoguedriven narrative but the latter resonated with me a bit more due to my area of work the only issue i have involves the winklevoss family armie hammer is excellent as both twins as is max minghella as divya narendra but their subplot occasionally drifts from the main story losing my interest for those short moments theres even a rowboat race that feels outofplace and unnecessary but i admit that its gorgeously shot and accompanied by a fantastic soundtrack despite this little misstep fincher continues to impress me with his outstanding directing techniques forcing the actors to prove their worth by making them go through their dialogues faster and implementing long takes every time thats possible all in all the social network is yet another masterful piece of cinema this time delivered by not one but two magnificent filmmakers david fincher and aaron sorkin employ their mutual perfectionism and meticulousness to create an extraordinarily engaging narrative boasting a nonlinear but tremendously effective structure the two pillars of any film  story and characters  are wonderfully built even reaching the point of making the viewer feel invested in a despicable yet fascinating protagonist jesse eisenberg shines in a careerdefining performance but andrew garfield and justin timberlake also rise to the necessary level of dedication dealing with the rapidfire dialogues and outstanding long takes seamlessly technically great camera work offers a realistic feel an addictive score increases the excitement levels and flawless editing makes the different timelines shift seamlessly despite an occasionally unnecessary irrelevant detour concerning a minor subplot this is another brilliant addition to finchers filmography ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog  i dont have a written review for each of the previous films but i did watch both and thoroughly enjoyed them john wick 2014 is one of the best movies of that year and one of the best action films ever however john wick chapter 2 2017 is a bit more convoluted and messy regarding its story and how it brings our protagonist back into the game but the franchises outstandingly choreographed fight sequences still make it tremendously entertaining and its precisely the mindblowing bonecrushing jawdropping extraordinarily long and brutally choreographed action scenes that make john wick one of the most badass characters in the history of cinema the academy has been looking for something new to make the oscars more popular and the creation of new categories has been their number one idea well nothing fits the show better than best stunt work obviously franchises like this one or mission impossible would become major successes at this award show these two sagas are undeniably the most important and crucial for the survival of truly real action what you see its what you get nowadays viewers already have their eyes set to acknowledge everything as cgi or some sort of visual effect ill never forget when i left my mission impossible  fallout screening and while getting out of the theater a group of friends was laughing around saying something along the lines of of course that scene is fake and this moment is cgi how can you believe that youre such a moron they were roasting one of their friends thinking he was the dumb one when he was probably the one who was laughing the hardest this definitely leaves me sad sad that people wont realize how incredible movies like these are how they genuinely work like crazy to provide the audience with real and authentic stunts yes its overthetop yes cgi and visual effects are still applied but just to little details like bullets blood falls or knife throwing which never distract you and yes it requires the audience to suspend their knowledge of physics in a few particular moments but thats the thing if youre pumped to watch a third film of a franchise youre a fan you know what its about and whats its tone john wick established itself in 2014 as a pure revenge story and an unbelievably realistic action movie the closest we will ever get to an assassin origin tale john wick chapter two deeply explored the institution that governs these assassins and all of the rules that they are bound by its a bit messier than the first one but its still a blast of entertainment parabellum has the best of both installments it has the bestchoreographed action ever seen on a big screen and some of the most impressive camera work ive ever witnessed in addition to this the narrative makes more sense and the characters decisions are logically or emotionally justifiable contrary to the second film the sound design is powerful and the cinematography plus the set design look stunning i would still argue that the pacing could have been better controlled the transitions between long action sequences and the respective pauses to move the plot forward arent always smooth some comedy bits that i dont think they really belong in this saga were added and while some work just fine others really dont fit this world besides that i dont really have much to complain about the cast is absolutely impeccable keanu reeves is battling with tom cruise for the biggest action movie star alive while cruise puts his life more in risk by performing especially dangerous stunts keanu has the resiliency and agility of a beast providing us with highspeed and hardtodo fight sequences halle berry sofia is one hell of a surprise i had no idea she was still capable of moving as she does in this film the stunts that she performs are crazily good laurence fishburne bowery king  ian mcshane winston and lance reddick charon also have their own shining moments but sofias dogs are deadly cute and they steal the show regarding the action stunts theyre all pretty memorable from a throwback to chapter twos mirror room to an astonishingly riveting chasing scene through the streets of new york everything chad stahelski and his talented crew throw at the audience is absolutely perfect i also love how the final act resembles the experience of playing a videogame you know when you have several levels each of them with their respective boss but the final boss is at the top of them all its kind of like legend of zelda ocarina of time when link has to eliminate an enemy in each floor in order to move up to the next one until he reaches ganondorf it might be the must nonsensical analogy that i have but its what my memory triggered in the end there are tons of set pieces for everyone to enjoy all in all john wick chapter 3  parabellum is everything fans of this franchise desired brutal bloody long loud and beautifullychoreographed fight sequences accompanied by a decent story that explored even more the assassins world chad stahelski is a master filmmaker who knows how an action movie should be filmed there are no sloppy editing or quick cuts here only extensive onetake scenes filled with outstanding stunt work from a phenomenal cast keanu reeves is one of the most incredible action film stars ever and halle berry surprises with her physical abilities with better control of its pacing and tone and a bit less defiance of physics  this could have easily been the best action movie of the century one of the best its still one hell of a tagline ",

considering it one of the years best as well as one of the best stephen king cinematic adaptations andy muschietti returning to the directors chair and having such a fantastic cast portraying the adult versions of the losers not only in terms of quality acting but also regarding how well the adults look like the older versions of the young actors are two of the main reasons why i was genuinely excited also the runtime longest horror movie ever definitely left me wondering how a horror flick could have the same duration of some of the most epic films in cinema well i got to be honest im disappointed its not a bad movie at all but it doesnt even come close to its predecessors heels i disagree with some headlines ive read though some say the comedy was misplaced taking away impact from emotional or dark moments theres barely a moment where it was expected seriousness and laughter kicked in instead but when it does occur it actually works i just think it wasnt as funny as the previous film overall granted bill hader as richie tozier is hilarious and a perfect cast as an adult finn wolfhard his chemistry with james ransone eddie kaspbrak resembles the one wolfhard and jack dylan grazer had therefore this these duo s being the comedy highlight some say the movie is too long now this is a tricky one usually when people feel bored or not as entertained as they wanted to be they tend to blame it on the films runtime especially if its over 100 minutes i agree that the movie feels long but i disagree that the runtime is too long theres more than enough story to explore and literally every single character from the losers club has an interesting arc the problem here is that not all of them are explored in a way thats funny scary or just captivating enough the fact that jessica chastains beverly marsh sequence with the old lady is entirely displayed in one of the trailers and consequently shown at every single screening doesnt help the pacing the first act is pretty decent as expected it shows us where everyone is what theyre doing for a living and how they get back together during this act its pretty clear that muschietti is going to give time to develop each character and follow their respective arcs to the end hence the lengthy runtime however the second act falls flat bill denbrough james mcavoy jaeden martell has the most emotionally impactful storyline one that affects the main plot making the time that is spent with him worth it same goes for richies subplot on the opposite side the rest of the group doesnt have entertaining sequences or new developments whatsoever beverly continues to be affected by her childhood of abuse from her father ben hanscom jay ryan jeremy ray taylor keeps being in love with bev eddie is still a whiny little kid whos scared of everything that might make him ill stanley uris andy bean wyatt oleff doesnt do anything and mike hanlon is surprisingly the engine that moves the plot forward which is a problem of its own since i never really cared for that character he was definitely the one put aside in the 2017s movie  honestly he just serves as an exposition device considering he spends the whole time just explaining everything the audience needs to know to understand where the film is going finally the third act is a mixed bag while it does provide a climactic ending with a sweet message it feels very much like its predecessor i dont want to spoil anything but its incredibly repetitive comparing to the first movie considering all things together its a big letdown since it feels like the exact same film but with older versions of the characters obviously each of them has a different arc in this one something the first didnt have the time to explore but looking at the main story its pretty much the exact same thing including how it ends just with a minor twitch  nevertheless the performances are all great james mcavoy continues his streak of amazing displays and bill hader has to be the mvp for the range he demonstrates i wish skarsg rd had more time to shine as pennywise though in 2017 i thought he really nailed the character and made it his own unfortunately this time around pennywise doesnt have that much screentime such a disappointment  and when it appears it often looks too cgiish taking away from the gripping performance of its actor the finale has almost no bill skarsg rd since theres so much cgi despite that i congratulate the team s behind the makeup hairstyling costume and production design derry looks terrific and the time jumps between the young and the old gang worked seamlessly partially due to these visual achievements andy muschietti knows how to work a camera and the movie is very wellshot however he should have been able to come up with creative sequences to deliver a different level of entertainment especially during the tiresome second act gary daubermans screenplay is clever and it brings this enormous story to a fitting conclusion but he also could have imagined some new ideas for some of the characters there are a couple of great sequences though especially one with bill going through a theme park tent with illusions in the end it chapter two fails to deliver a conclusion worthy of its epic runtime even with a phenomenal cast it isnt as funny as scary or even as captivating as its predecessor its runtime is appropriated having in mind that each character has a personal arc but only a couple of them are genuinely compelling and entertaining therefore the film feels too long uneven and it could have used a bit more creativity when it comes to its climactic finale its central story feels very similar to the last movie its scary sequences are nowhere near the quality seen before and even though the costume and production design are topnotch theres excessive use of cgi on pennywise it still carries some emotionally convincing moments as well as a couple of cool sequences overall its okay ",

of every film ive ever seen however if i had to write this special list i have no doubts that se7en would be there obviously this is a rewatch of the classic movie that impacted filmmaking and launched david finchers remarkable career i also ignore the fact that alien 3 is connected to fincher due to the known production issues  with his next film mank coming up on netflix in a few weeks i decided to go through part of his filmography se7en will be the first out of five finchers movies that i will be able to revisit throughout this week ive seen this film countless times but to be completely honest i havent seen it in so long that i didnt remember exactly some important plot points and a key component about the ending this helped me experience se7en in a fascinating way once again andrew kevin walkers screenplay has one of the most intriguing mysterious captivating narratives ive ever witnessed still to this day from the very beginning to the last second im constantly at the edge of my seat in this case my couch with severe anxiety levels and feeling incredibly tense biting my nails moving my leg up and down changing positions its so mesmerizing that im only writing about it more than twentyfour hours after i watched it one of the most impressive aspects is how fincher is able to leave the viewer uncomfortable with showing only a single death onscreen this is an extremely dark gory bloodsoaked gruesome flick packed with horrible displays of dead bodies but never the actual murder scene with just a simple photo or a straight line of dialogue fincher lets the viewers imagination do the work and its undoubtedly as or more effective than a visually horrific killing sequence as the premise implies the serial killer is inspired by the seven deadly sins and he goes after the respective sinners killing them or letting them kill themselves in an innovative fashion turning the sin against the sinner the gluttony and sloth cases are visually brutal but the lust murder is the one that keeps haunting my memory the latter is also the less explicit left to openminded people to imagine the despicable act in 1995 a movie with such a dismal environment and dark story couldnt be wellreceived and se7en got its fair share of negative reviews stating that it was too obscure sinister overly violent and that the ending was absolutely unacceptable over time it found its success it gained fans all around the world and its now considered by many as one of the greatest films ever made myself included from the outstanding cast to the astonishingly enthralling detective work the third act stands out as one of the most shocking endings of alltime im keeping this review spoilerfree because i dont want readers who have not seen this movie to have such a magnificent piece of cinema ruined for them thats why im also hiding a certain actor from the starring section just like the marketing team did at the original date of release ill get there  finchers third act is simply flawless everything displayed onscreen in the last twenty minutes is filmmaking perfection from the impressively suspenseful buildup to that jawdropping climactic moment passing through a mindblowing revelation se7ens conclusion is and will remain as one of the most brutally shocking endings in the history of cinema morgan freeman and brad pitt share fantastic chemistry portraying two iconic characters that couldnt be more different than one another somerset is a notable detective with extreme attention to detail knowledgeable and always curious about the case at hand freeman incorporates this character effortlessly delivering a subtle yet powerful performance pitt portrays mills a childish unfocused immature replacement to the previous detective about to retire despite its apparent lack of work ethics mills is clever relentless in finding the killer and desperately wants to prove himself pitt just like freeman embodies this persona seamlessly and also gives an outstanding interpretation technically where should i begin from the haunting score of howard shore to the documentarylike cinematography darius khondji that offers a tremendously realistic atmosphere its the phenomenal production design that stands out fincher really wanted the dirty rainy depressing city to feel authentic and as real as possible the first dialogues of the film are meant to point out the bleakness and awfulness of the city but even without these conversations any viewer will be able to acknowledge the absence of color joyfulness and life in this unknown location finchers filmmaking techniques are demonstrated in plain splendor for everyone to see and this was just his beginning movies like se7en are impossible to be made today period it would never be conceivable to completely hide one of the main actors from the press tour and or trailers we live in a time where the promotion of a film must have everything and everyone nowadays trailers show way too much and this isnt news to anyone the ending was forced by pitt and fincher since the studio wanted a more mainstream conclusion today filmmakers may have more freedom but there are still countless cases of executive producers changing a movie without the directors will and or permission se7en was a film released in a time where it should have never been released in the first place fortunately it was se7en might be the best directors sophomore movie in the history of cinema and its undoubtedly one of my favorite films of alltime david finchers classic possesses one of the most captivating screenplays ive ever witnessed marked by an extremely dark somber violent gruesome story that ends with one of the most emotionally shocking conclusions to a movie ever the lack of onscreen death scenes is both the most surprising and effectively powerful element of the whole film leaving the unpleasant work of imagining a specific type of murder to the viewers mind morgan freeman and brad pitt are extraordinary as the now iconic detectives delivering two truly brilliant performances finchers trademark filmmaking style started here as every technical aspect contributes to the movies incredible realism from the simple documentarylike camera work to the ominous score its the authentic production design that sets the depressing tone the bleak atmosphere and the rainy colorless lifeless city overall its a technically flawless piece of art one of the greatest films ever made  i cant recommend it more  ",

will always be subjective but in my opinion this year has examples at every point of the spectrum ive witnessed some shockingly awful horror flicks fantasy island the grudge the turning you should have left  a few wasted potential examples gretel hansel the rental the new mutants  some pretty decent ones underwater antebellum come play  and more than just a couple of incredible films some might even end up in my top10 of the year the invisible man the lodge  i didnt know much about relic but its premise got me interested this is natalie erika james directorial debut as well as her first featurelength screenplay cowritten with the also firsttimer christian white boasting a relatively unknown cast to me at least  i cant hide my surprise regarding how much i enjoy this film ambiguous horror movies with underlying themes are far from being an audiencefavorite subgenre much on the contrary usually this type of film possesses traits that a regular moviegoer doesnt really look forward to a slow pace a series of suspenseful sequences that dont lead to the generic jumpscare and finally an ending that apparently might miss some sort of explanation leaving the audience feeling underwhelmed well guess what i love this subgenre especially when it really hits me in the heart it has all the ingredients above that i know will make most people think this didnt make any sense its so boring many viewers will expect just another spooky supernatural psychological horror flick and disappointment will meet them at the end however its narrative carries so much more than whats on the surface and honestly this is made clear pretty early in the movie at its core relic is quite a realistic depiction of what happens to the older members of some families unfortunately more than what it should be  and it approaches extremely sensitive themes such as dementia and the abandonment of old people in nursing homes natalie and christians screenplay doesnt hide from delivering a few messages concerning these two topics dementia is a terrible disease that amongst other things makes people lose what makes them unique what makes them human and forget who they truly are if our parents take care of us throughout our young life its only fitting that we take care of them when if they begin to fail to do so themselves not only should we do this because they already did the same for us when we were young but also due to the possibility that our descendants might have to do the same when we grow old its a variation of the known circle of life love should always be present no matter the circumstances a little piece of my personal life my grandfather wasnt quite there at the end he gradually became unable to drive walk and eventually speak i chose to not see him as much as i did in his last few weeks simply because i didnt want to remember him as someone he wasnt my memory of him is intact with the best moments ive spent with him and not that depressing phase at a nursing home just laying in bed waiting for his time to leave our world its a small portion of my life that i share with you so you understand how relic can impact so many viewers if people give it a legitimate chance with adequate expectations the acting is phenomenal across the board robyn nevin can be scary as the grandmother edna but in the end shes the emotional trigger that made me tear up there are little nuances in her expressions that elevate her overall performance emily mortimer is also outstanding as the mom kay who has to go through all stages in dealing with a parent with dementia from rejection and separation to acceptance and unconditional love kay is the character that gets a more significant focus bella heathcote might have less screentime than the other two but shes also fantastic as sam particularly in the horror sequences nevertheless its precisely this last point that hurts the film the houses atmosphere is incredibly suspenseful but the third act brings out an unexpected level of horror which i believe to be exaggerated the balance between horror and family drama was excellent throughout the first two acts except for short periods here and there but the last twenty minutes go through such an overthetop eerie extremely fictional path that ultimately ruins that nearperfect balance its almost like the producers came in and said we need more horror so they filmed a bunch of crazy mindbending physicsdefying scenes this movie didnt need any of that and it should have stuck with the intriguing drama instead of forcing the disturbing horror technically charlie sarroffs camera work is impeccable with the help of denise haratzi and sean lahiffs editing long takes strongly improve the buildup to the scary sequences generating exceptional levels of tension and suspense brian reitzells score is interesting but theres a point in the film where it gets a bit awkward having in mind the scene taking place but it doesnt hurt his overall work great pacing control adequate runtime and a beautiful heartfelt relevant ending that unfortunately some viewers wont be able to see past its apparently underwhelming climax all in all relic is one of those typical horror movies that will divide critics and audiences all around the world this time only false expectations can lead to disappointment natalie erika james directorial debut is far from being a generic horror flick but a family drama with a very sensitive matter at its core with the help of the also debutant christian white both deliver an exceptionally wellwritten genuinely sad yet realistic story about dementia and how old people are treated once they cant live by themselves anymore a remarkably ambiguous narrative filled with underlying themes leads to an emotionally powerful ending if the viewer is able to understand the implicit messages spread across the runtime emily mortimer robyn nevin and bella heathcote all deliver exceptional performances technically the lingering cinematography plus seamless editing create an extraordinarily suspenseful environment however the third act dives into horror way too much holding unnecessary sequences that only ruin the films tone raising questions that dont belong in the movie still i sincerely recommend it to anyone who enjoys this type of film but please manage your expectations as fair as possible  ",

editor all work together to deliver the most immersive war movie probably ever yes it has a simple premise and the main narrative is basic but the remarkable technical achievement elevates this film so freaking much even if you dont know the slightest thing about filmmaking or how movies are made its impossible to watch this film and not think something feels different about this one this is a movie meant to be watched at the biggest best screen possible watching 1917 at home on a tv or a laptop is not going to work at all throughout the whole runtime i felt like i was there with schofield and blake it feels like we are a third soldier going with them on a vital mission to save thousands of lives i believe 1917 is the best one shot film to date ive been using the quote signs for a reason dont mistake it for an actual one shot movie  with birdman as a close second if the latter deals with a lot more dialogue and acting the former has dozens of nailbiting sequences featuring shootouts explosions and a lot of running walking swimming through mud dead corpses blood and way too many nasty rats i really have no words to describe roger deakins cinematography its not merely a film its a whole experience its not just another cool technical achievement its the entire foundation of 1917 and the main reason why so many people are rushing to the theater however a lot of people are completely ignoring lee smiths work dont forget this isnt an actual one shot movie if its been edited to look like one continuous take and if it actually does appear to be a single take then the editor should get as much recognition as everyone else yes he doesnt have to work with thousands of cuts i counted 14 but im sure theres more  but they still exist and he has to make sure no one feels them and he did so perfectly my last paragraph concerning the technical aspects has to go to sam mendes and thomas newman as the director mendes is able to deliver precisely what he envisioned and seamlessly coordinate his actors not only has he directed my favorite bond film skyfall  but he also offers one of my favorite war movies of alltime as for newman i just wish that joker had been released in another year because 1917s score is fantastic hildur gu nad ttir is likely taking the oscar for best original score but if thomas newman takes it ill still be delighted a lot of comparisons are being made with christopher nolans dunkirk theyre similar films regarding the fact that their main goal is to provide the most immersive war experience story and characterwise both movies dont really develop that much nolans film is loved by most critics and audiences all around the world but one common complaint about it is the lack of character building i didnt mind that at all because the movie never actually tried to make their characters important they were just soldiers caught in the worst of situations similar to 1917 however i do think the latter does a better job of making us care for the protagonists george mackay and deancharles chapmans characters have small arcs but they exist in the beginning blake is the emotionaldriven character while schofield seems to be the rational one we as the audience care about the mission first but as time goes by we learn about their personal traits and motivations by the end of the film i was crying both play off of each other really well but its their dialogue that impresses me the most what seems to be just a random talk while strolling through an open field of grass it truly isnt if its not meaningful at the time its going to be the acting is more physical than anything and both deliver outstanding performances i would say i love 1917 as much as i love dunkirk i might be tempted to choose the former due to the recency effect but theres one small aspect that negatively affects both their replay value is not as high as other films since their technical achievements dont work as well on a regular tv in the comfort of our own home you will never feel or understand that immersive experience that everyone talks about you wont know what made people to be blown away you wont love it as much as everyone else so please do not miss 1917 in theaters sam mendes roger deakins and lee smith director director of photography editor three key filmmaking roles in the creation of one of the best wwi movies of alltime edited to look like one continuous shot 1917 is a mindblowing technical achievement elevated by deakins always jawdropping cinematography thomas newman emotionally powerful score mendes impeccable directing and smiths seamless editing george mackay and deancharles chapman deliver outstanding physical performances but its the astonishing filmmaking that steals the spotlight production design costume design sound you name it everything is absolutely perfect its meant to be seen at the biggest screen near you since this is an incredibly immersive experience that you wont get at home its going straight into my top10 best movies of 2019 and i hope youll love it as much as i do ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog when it comes to horror im always willing to give any film a shot even when everything indicates its probably going to be a massive failure im admittedly not a saw fanatic despite quite enjoying the first two movies after these i cant even remember which installments i actually watched or not not even the most recent jigsaw caught my attention in preparation for spiral i tried to determine precisely how it would be placed in the sagas timeline which proved to be a surprisingly challenging task basically what matters for this film is that john walker tobin bell and his work as the jigsaw serial killer are acknowledged making this a sequel with that said unfortunately spiral doesnt change my opinion about the franchise its a formuladriven saga that no one really cares about too much anymore in fact im pretty shocked by the fact that this installment was even greenlit having in mind the particularly sensitive times our society lives in countless movies and tv shows are held to stricter standards nowadays with the risk of getting canceled or boycotted if a certain subject is treated poorly with so much gratuitous violence its surprising to see this franchise still alive boasting curious casting choices  chris rock leading a horror flick is definitely an attentiongrabber  the extremely bloody gory trap killings are packed with lifeordeath dilemmas as always which will surely please hardcore fans however these are just not as captivating or fun as before this movie doesnt possess a single memorable trap that surpasses any of the dozens hundreds from before just like josh stolberg and peter goldfingers screenplay its just another lazy unsurprising variation of a wellknown formula to be fair and im trusting other critics who watched all of the other installments this is supposedly the version that separates the most from the structure people first witnessed in 2004 and 2005 still being different doesnt mean better and the competition isnt exactly defined by masterpieces from my perspective spiral is just another generic take on an overdone story from the repetitively identical kidnapping sequences to the consequent traps the potential of a great film depended on how darren lynn bousman saw ii iii iv and the duo of writers tackled the characters mainly the protagonist the lack of characterization is definitely a problem but the baffling laziness in storytelling ruins the entire flow of the movie with an overwhelming amount of flashbacks and an incredibly choppy annoying editing work dev singh  the nonstop heightened super tense atmosphere transforms every single scene like its the most crucial moment of the film consequently a vast majority of the dialogues are characters screaming and cursing at each other in almost every interaction the outofcontrol tone negatively affects the casts performances many people will look at chris rock dolemite is my name madagascar and believe hes delivering an overthetop display but hes just following the chaotic environment established by the director during the first minutes of the movie rock is amusing and funny as expected but hes also able to tap his more dramatic side however when every single line of dialogue needs to be interpreted as if its the most vital part of the film very few actors can pull it off samuel l jackson glass spiderman far from home is one of them but his expectedly short screentime doesnt allow for much entertainment though its always special seeing slj cursing at someone finally saw is also about finding out who is responsible for the disgusting game and spiral doesnt remove that essential block of narrative the issue here is the lack of a jawdropping revelation obviously this is as subjective as everything you just read until now but i would be astonished if most viewers didnt guess who the new jigsaw copycat is during the first act i do want to end on a positive note so ill compliment the bold ending it partially holds the studio against the wall in the sense that the probability of this movie getting a sequel being higher which can make some viewers think its too forced i rather believe they just wanted to have an intense finale which i cant really deny spiral might offer enough blood gore and brutal traps murders to fans of the franchise but overall its still just another lazy predictable take on the saw formula despite the violently captivating lifeordeath sequences none stands out as an unforgettable moment josh stolberg and peter goldfingers screenplay lacks efficient character development impactful revelations and honestly a massive amount of creativity from the repetitively tiresome flashbacks and kidnapping scenes to the extremely outofcontrol tone darren lynn bousman isnt able to take the story to its potential everything is dialed up to its maximum as if every single line of dialogue needs to be screamed from the top of a mountain which transforms the entire atmosphere into a chaotic environment chris rock cant be the only one to blame for his overtense line deliveries especially when he starts so well a strong yet abrupt ending doesnt compensate for such dull storytelling i wish i could write that im disappointed but i didnt have high expectations for this one  ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog charlie kaufman is undeniably one of the greatest writers of the 2000s being john malkovich and eternal sunshine of the spotless mind are some of his most notable works but its synecdoche new york thats considered by many as one of the best films of the respective decade therefore i was obviously excited about his return to liveaction movies since 2008 hes only made the animated feature anomalisa  im thinking of ending things boasts an incredibly talented cast capable of seating me down and make me watch any film they participate in even though jessie buckley dolittle is sort of a new face to me my expectations were moderately high so how did it go im not going to lie i found this movie so intricate that i had a really hard time figuring it all out as soon as it ended i knew i didnt understand it in full which generated an unusual yet refreshing feeling inside me i felt the need to not only think about the film all night but since i didnt have the time to watch it again i returned to a few specific scenes in the next morning i also researched a bit and talked with a fellow critic to settle some of my minds internal debates i write this to imply that this is not an easy movie to decipher which will definitely throw some people off its a film that requires all of the viewers attention and selfquestioning capability otherwise things will get complicated as usual im not sharing any spoilers so ill keep my opinion about the storys multiple interpretations to the bare minimum of all the numerous ways of explaining this movie i found two either from jessie buckleys characters perspective or from jesse plemons i like both for different reasons in terms of logic which every viewer will struggle to find plemons character is the key to understand the remarkably complex multilayered narrative looking at the film from his perspective everything makes much more sense however its surprisingly from buckleys view that i find the movies message to be more interesting and likely to resonate with most people making an impactful move in life requires determination courage decisiveness moving to another country switching jobs ending a relationship all can be extremely demanding and psychologically painful im thinking of ending things brilliantly demonstrates how one can delay these actions sometimes indefinitely from the excruciatingly long car drives almost an hour of the runtime is spent inside the car listening to the main characters debating apparently random philosophical themes to the enigmatic transitions of time passing by kaufmans screenplay keeps transmitting a message of how people are stationary and time just keeps flowing this film takes ambiguousness and metaphoric filmmaking to a whole other level not only everything the viewer is seeing has in some shape or form a philosophical meaning but the dialogues between the main characters are themselves about cultural intellectual sophisticated matters some of these conversations have an eventual impact in the narrative or in the characters some just feel like kaufman needed to express his thoughts on several subjects with a runtime of slightly over two hours this movie overstays its welcome a bit due to the insistence in delivering repetitive similar scenes with the same goal the time shenanigans performed in the parents house is undoubtedly intriguing but its more distracting than helpful storywise having in mind the already puzzling narrative the confusion associated with understanding how time works only creates even more doubts it also deviates the viewers attention from the real focus which didnt help my first viewing in fact i was so concentrated trying to comprehend the purpose behind the oldyoung versions of the characters that i completely lost track of the runtime ultimately thinking the film was near its ending when it still had forty minutes to go theres a limit to how abstract and implicit a movie can be without becoming genuinely hard to understand and kaufman walks that threshold successful sometimes not that much in other moments nevertheless i can only share compliments from now on firstly the cast ive been in love with anything toni collette does since hereditary and once again shes weirdly captivating as an amusing yet disturbing mother david thewlis offers a subtler performance as well as jesse plemons even though the latter explodes with emotion in the third act however jessie buckley steals the spotlight in impeccable fashion like i mentioned in the beginning i know very little of her as an actress but ill make sure to add her to the list of actresses to follow closely with one of the biggest emotional ranges seen this year she delivers an incredibly captivating display one that should guarantee her name in future contenders list for the awards season from citing entire poems to fiercely debating any topic thrown at her by plemons her commitment to the role is palpable an astonishing performance that i will remember for a long time however its in the technical realm that this film achieves perfection without the shadow of a doubt this is the best movie of the year when it comes to the technical attributes until the date of this review obviously  almost every filmmaking element carries a tremendous impact in either the narrative or its characters the purposefully rough editing robert frazen adds to the perplexing atmosphere the lighting plus the production molly hughes and set design mattie siegal help identify where a particular event is happening the detailed costume design melissa toth and the impressive makeup are vital to the understanding of everything that occurs in the parents house the distinct cinematography ukasz al elevates every single action performed by the characters its a technically flawless film and i wouldnt be surprised to see it being nominated for several categories when the time comes im thinking of ending things might be a netflix original movie but it screams a24 all the way from the incredibly perplexing narrative told through bizarre storytelling to its distinctly unconventional technical characteristics charlie kaufman offers a remarkably complex film that can take different interpretations and may require more than one viewing  his insistence in transmitting one of the films messages through neverending philosophical conversations and confusing timebending distractions stretch the story to an unnecessary long runtime that hurts the overall piece nevertheless all messages are successfully delivered through an intriguing headscratching weirdly captivating story packed with cultural debates and unique characters an absolutely outstanding jessie buckley elevates every single line of dialogue showing tremendous emotional range but the impressively talented cast also improves the multilayered screenplay technically it is and it will remain as one of the best movies of the year every technical aspect is close to perfection and almost all have a massive impact on the story and how the viewer interprets it it will undoubtedly create a gap between critics and audiences since it has all the ingredients that usually place these groups at opposite extremes i can only recommend it to people who are able to dedicate their full attention to what theyre watching while being capable of selfquestioning its not your usual netflix flick to pop during tedious home tasks to help pass the time so make sure you know what

networks during holidays in my country usually during christmas the liveaction films of 1996 and 2000 are stored somewhere in my memory even though i never really sat down and watched the movies all by myself cruella might just be another liveaction film from the mickey mouse studio but its far from being yet another remake much on the contrary just like the vast majority of the companys villains cruella de vil portrayed by glenn close in the previous installments was even worse than the generic antagonist with cliche motivations that eventually every studio used and reused to exhaustion besides cruellas greedy necessities purely evil personality and extreme vanity this wicked character was driven by something completely unthinkable skinning shorthaired puppies to have more success in the fashion industry due to their soft fur anyone with a conscience knows that disney would never bring this character back to the big screen in 2021 without making some changes especially regarding this motivation in particular how would a movie with a dogkilling protagonist at its front and center be remotely successful obviously this hardcore motif no longer belongs to emma stones cruellas defining character traits which might be a nono for those viewers who are more protective of the original material as if times and culture didnt change from decade to decade since the start of disneys liveaction remakes campaign audiences have been divided about how to feel and what to expect from these films some wish for a copypaste version of the same story while others desire a completely different take on the wellknown narrative however the best experience  and the primary goal of these movies  is a mix of both a version that keeps the essence and the message of the original while bringing something new and different to the table to justify its existence cruella isnt a remake but an origin al story based on a classic villain and its undoubtedly one of the best films ive seen this year until this day i didnt expect to write an extensive review but with so much to address i know my thoughts will take a while to transcribe to this article let me start with some easy elements that everyone can see and enjoy without having to go into deep analysis mode the costume design is indisputably the technical standout the colorfully stunning dresses steal the show visually but its how it differentiates estella and cruella that jenny beavan shines in her job just from what stone wears the viewers can easily decipher what character shes playing the differences between the glamorous rich people that the baroness surrounds herself with and the dirty poor friends estella meets at the beginning of the movie  jasper joel fry and horace paul walter hauser  is also accentuated through their wardrobes the extravagant parties are packed with oscarworthy costumes but also with beautiful makeup hair nadia stacey and absolutely ravishing production design fiona crombie  nicholas britells score carries little references to the music of the other installments as does the film itself craig gillespie doesnt hide the easter eggs spread throughout the runtime of which some will definitely please the most avid fans technically its as gorgeous as one came to expect from the studio but not everything is as impressive as the aspects above in a movie where even the blackandwhite hair and clothes of cruella pop off the screen the cgi backgrounds and animals are way too noticeable for the studio that just made a hyperrealistic remake of the lion king cgi dogs are employed during most of the runtime which is not only understandable but also commendable animal violence in filmmaking is a serious topic that fortunately was solved long ago however the vfx dont look good enough causing the dogs  mainly the dalmatians  to be an unintended distraction in addition to this a specific outdoor location thats quite important to the story is surrounded by an awfully dark fake background that just feels way too off finally the ending boasts a ridiculous sequence made with terrible cgi that will definitely leave the more logicdriven viewers stunned with disappointment i consider this a nitpick especially since its not a film without silliness in fact cruellas success partially rests on gillespies tone balance jasper and horace become the comicrelief characters starring in the absurd action sequences that occur at parties and other places they decide to steal from now some people might expect that since the other movies are defined by their irrational fun however dana fox and tony mcnamaras screenplay carries undeniable similarities to the devil wears prada and the most recent joker estellas life story is far from being a happy tale and cruellas rise even less overall the balance between the silly comedy and the more dramatic depressing traumatic storyline is mostly wellhandled but there are a few moments where gillespie lets it too loose especially in the overdisneyish last fifteen minutes so lets address the two protagonists estella and cruella the comparisons with joaquin phoenixs take on arthur fleck joker are impossible to unsee from the upbringing filled with bullying and family tragedy to the final transformation emma stones character follows a similar arc but with clear differences concerning the solution for her problems estella dreams of being a fashion designer and idolizes the selfcentered selfindulgent baroness which takes her down a learning path of how to be successful in the business the baroness despicable treatment of estella brings the ruthless cruella gradually back to life eventually stealing the spotlight from the lovely little estella who just wanted to do what she loved for a living without having to carry on extreme measures an unexpected clever twist pretty much completes the protagonists transformation which genuinely caught me by surprise i admit that i didnt have high hopes for this origin story nevertheless the wellwritten screenplay deeply explores a previously hollow villain offering her a touching backstory and comprehensible motivations while its true that she possesses dozens of identical characteristics to the infamous baroness cruella never truly becomes 100 that person honestly i wouldnt mind seeing a sequel but i dont think theres room for another film that wouldnt hurt the one we just got so theres just one more aspect to delve into the casts performances joel fry and paul walter hauser are truly hilarious as the famous duo of thieves both share a compelling connection to estella one that i believe deserved a better conclusion they become a family living and stealing throughout their lives but when estella starts giving cruella some screentime a few issues arise within the trio these problems are indeed approached and solved but in a less dramatic manner than i hoped for fry is excellent as the more competent rational jasper but hauser never stops being extremely funny the beforementioned balance is rarely affected by the characters comedic banter which is something the actors also deserve credit for emma thompson delivers one of my favorite performances of her recent filmography interpreting the baroness von hellman how can you make an extremely overthetop character feel cartoonish yet strangely real someone who clearly feels like an exaggeration of a stereotype but still resembles dozens of people from the real world thompson takes her role and the only reason why she doesnt steal the spotlight from everyone else is because the other emma rises to the challenge of portraying such a classic villain with obvious references to miranda priestly from the devil wears prada thompson is able to be amusing and vile in the same scene making every second with her on screen feel incredibly captivating nevertheless emma stone manages to stay a level above everyone else i firmly believe that shes one of the best actresses of her generation carrying one of the most expressive faces in hollywood stone was born to play a protagonist with two personalities without looking at the screen any viewer will be able to know if shes talking as estella or cruella not only she changes the tone of her voice depending on the character but the mannerisms alter as well it would be a massive surprise if such an early disney performance got an oscar nomination so her chances are obviously thin however if there was an award for best monologue stone would be a strong contender i dont recall how many minutes it really is but i cant forget that long uncut take with stone at the center of the screen with nothing but her acting the hell out of an emotionally impactful monologue switching between estella and cruella in the span of milliseconds her microexpressions elevate a heartfelt characterdefining speech that will undoubtedly mark this year of cinema stone gives not one but two impressive attentiongrabbing performances that will satisfy most viewers looking for a cruella they can understand and even root for cruella is not only one of 2021s biggest surprises but its also one of the best movies of the year so far despite the occasional lack of balance between the silly comedy and the dramatic narrative craig gillespie offers an incredibly captivating origin al story about one of disneys classic villains dana fox and tony mcnamaras remarkable screenplay profoundly explores the estellacruella transformation giving her nondogkilling emotionally compelling motivations a traumatic depressing past

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog the superhero genre has been growing exponentially during the last decade so its bizarre to go through an entire year with only birds of prey and the new mutants instead of literally dozens of films from both marvel and dc thankfully warner bros decided to release wonder woman 1984 before the years end but not without a catch most people will only have the possibility of watching one of the few blockbusters of 2020 through hbo max a streaming service only available in a couple of countries while some incredibly lucky moviegoers might have the chance of seeing this visually epic film in theaters depending on the countrys pandemic rules fortunately im one of those lucky people who got the opportunity to end 2020 on a positively immersive note by watching patty jenkins latest flick in an almost empty imax theater paradise  if youve been following me for some time you know im a firm believer and defender of the socalled theater experience and i cant hide the fact that i felt extremely emotional going into one of the best biggest theaters in portugal to witness one of my most anticipated movies of 2020 until 2017 dceu struggled to deliver a massively loved installment and wonder woman came to the rescue it was one of my favorite films of the respective year so i was obviously excited for its sequel even more having in mind the circumstances were all living in in my opinion this sequel stands close to its predecessor with a lengthy runtime known for being associated with absolutely epic movies i was confident that ww84 could deliver a solid film with great villains for a change well kristen wigg and pedro pascal are definitely two of the indisputable standouts patty jenkins geoff johns and david callaham made the right decision in dedicating a significant portion of the screenplay to barbara minerva and max lord their arcs are far from being groundbreaking but theyre a thousand times more effective than the cg punch bag narrative barbara follows the lonely insignificant no one cares about me archetype and wiig does a surprisingly remarkable job in portraying this character but the script is what really makes her shine at first her comedic mannerisms left me a bit dubious about the eventual characters likeness however as time flies by its almost inevitable to feel sorry for barbara making her future motivations understandable and perfectly natural on the other hand max lord is apparently exploding with conviction but his life is not as amazing as everyone might think this time its pedro pascal who ends up elevating the character delivering a brilliant performance with just the right amount of overthetop expressions even though these two are magnificent gal gadot continues to prove that shes one of the best casting choices of the millennium interpreting diana prince aka wonder woman i seriously cannot imagine another actress wearing that costume throwing that lasso of truth incorporating the characters essence as seamless as gadot in this movie she was able to perform highly emotional scenes nailing every single one her chemistry with chris pine steve trevor is palpable on the other side of the world and their interactions go through every zone of the emotion spectrum regarding steve im not going to spoil how he comes back or anything concerning his arc but i can safely write that his presence in the film is both necessary and logical the biggest compliment ill offer this sequel concerns its screenplay and direction finally i can confidently write that the dceu is capable of producing a wellstructured welldeveloped story with wellwritten characters it doesnt have as much action as the original but i still didnt feel the 151 minutes ww84 flows incredibly well due to jenkins ability to fill up the runtime almost only with important scenes theres a slight overpersistence in the attempt at sending a certain message ill get there  but storywise i sincerely wouldnt take a second out even the comic relief moments particularly with pine who plays some sort of parallelism with the first movies diana  are welcome and timely the action scenes might be low on quantity but the few that the audience gets are long complex and technically challenging to pull off the opening sequence alone almost made me tear up due to its epicness hans zimmers powerful score richard pearsons clean editing and matthew jensens camera work all work together to present a lengthy grand wide view of an olympicsstyle obstacle course with young diana throughout the entire film the action is colorful vibrant fun and entertaining except for the supposedly climactic clash well to be fair there are two climaxes during the last thirty minutes since ww84 owns two antagonists to play with one of them is closed in perfect fashion with the emotional stakes at their highest great job there no complaints whatsoever however the main fight sequence inexplicably contrasts with the rest of the movies action the vibrant colors disappear and are replaced by a dull grey which makes one of the characters involved who shares the same color tone hard to notice transforming an epic final battle into an underwhelming barely comprehensible collection of awkward cuts punches and screams gadots golden suit is way less exciting and poorly lit than her original costume and barbaras arc ends without real closure in addition to this jenkins insists too much on passing to the audience that greed brings horrible consequences be careful what you wish for money and power cant buy happiness be thankful for what you have and messages along these lines are repeated continuously implicitly and explicitly  i admit that it might be a nitpick of mine and that not many people will feel like i did but i couldnt help but feel that some moments sounded and or seemed a bit preachy and way too repetitive also its a bit weird how the official premise mentions wiig as cheetah but this word is not mentioned once in the entire film nevertheless dont be mistaken im thrilled that ww84 is the last flick i watch at a theater this year all in all wonder woman 1984 proves that dc continues on the track of success by delivering a wellstructured welldeveloped dceu installment without an absurd amount of overwhelming cgi and or forgettable villains patty jenkins geoff johns and david callahams impressively layered screenplay makes the lengthy runtime feel adequate not only by offering epic exciting technically superb action set pieces but also due to the remarkably wellwritten heroes and antagonists gal gadot and chris pine are outstanding together but kristen wiig and pedro pascal steal the show as the newcomers with two wonderful villains ww84 boasts a solid elaborate narrative that i was lucky to witness on the big screen unfortunately the climactic battle is disappointingly underwhelming and colorless barbaras arc ends abruptly without true closure and jenkins insists too much on the thematic message of the story these issues may affect more viewers or not but one things for sure its one of the most entertaining movies ive seen all year worthy of being seen on a massive theater ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog ive been an advocate for apple tv since i saw servant i genuinely believe its the most underrated streaming service out there especially in my country even though ive only watched one tv show ive yet to seriously dislike a single film wolfwalkers palmer on the rocks  which only elevated my already high expectations for cherry i sincerely appreciate the magnificent genredefining work that the russo brothers did in the marvel cinematic universe mainly with the last avengers flicks so id always be interested in seeing how they handle things outside of the mcu cast tom holland the devil all the time onward as the protagonist and youve got yourself one of the most anticipated movies of the first half of 2021 one of the best attributes of the russo brothers filmmaking style is their incredible capability of tackling an overwhelming amount of distinct storylines and characters without ruining the films pacing tone and narrative structure less is more is not exactly a guideline followed by these directors which is far from being an issue in the superhero genre however when it comes to a smaller movie like cherry the combination of genres and different narratives deeply hurts the overarching story what starts as a simple cute love story transitions to a heavy war actiondrama and ends with a monotonous dull slowpaced plot surrounding drug addiction ptsd and bank robberies these three storylines have served as individual premises to hundreds of films throughout cinema history this doesnt mean they cant be developed in a single movie but angela russootstot and jessica goldbergs screenplay needed to be better structured the first half of the film is quite captivating and entertaining to say the least cherry tom holland and emily ciara bravo are two compelling characters who get emotionally attached naturally making the eventual dilemma that leads cherry to join the army pretty convincing besides being a reasonably common situation in this first genre shift the tone changes without issues and the entire war plot is definitely worth the viewers investment this portion of the movie is where the directors shine high production value goes into creating riveting action set pieces and newton thomas sigels energetic camera work elevates every major sequence marvel fans will surely be delighted during this subplot but the films biggest problem comes with its second half featuring an extremely abrupt genre transition cherry goes downhill throughout its last 80 minutes or so drowning itself in a pool of taboo subjects from the drastic drop in pace to the dismal tone cherry and emily go through a painfully repetitive cliche drug addiction story adding ptsd and silly bank robberies to the mix doesnt work at all overall its an incredibly messy screenplay that tries to do too much but the russo brothers overwhelming directing method also doesnt quite work for the movie excess of slowmotion an allovertheplace score henry jackman  its actually quite good just not used appropriately  and numerous camera angles that despite delivering gorgeous shots distract the viewer from the actual story which should be the main focus cherry feels like a showcase for what the famous brothers can do with a smaller budget while theyre successful in demonstrating their talent behind the camera its not something they needed to prove to the audience who just wants to watch a film with great story and characters not be confused by technical wonders that have no place in this movie in the middle of the directing and writing chaos tom holland sweeps in and delivers his careerbest performance in my humble opinion i strongly believe he could be an oscarwinner by the end of the decade at 26yearsold holland shows an exceptional emotional range particularly powerful in interpreting the most solemn emotions add a fantastic physical display and youve got yourself an actor who can basically do anything with this role holland deeply explores his acting skills performing shocking scenes that everyone will find hard to watch due to his allout commitment ciara bravo might start as just a pretty face but the problematic second half actually helps her get out of her shell and step up her game excellent portrayal surprising even from someone who doesnt have that big of a featurefilm career cherry is an indisputable mess but it hangs on due to a captivating first half a careerbest performance from tom holland and an overall wellshot film the frustrating damaging mishmash of genres might originate from the rumpled screenplay but the unnecessary directing showcase for the russo brothers also hurts the multiplenarrative movie the generic yet accurate less is more motto wasnt used during the making of this film something proved by the sumptuous yet distracting camera angles a gripping yet allovertheplace score and an impactful yet excessive use of slowmotion the first part boasts a compelling entertaining storyline featuring an authentic love story and a war drama packed with outstanding action set pieces however its other half heavily drops the pacing and depressingly changes the tone leading the viewer into a tiresome formulaic much less interesting storyline despite all that hollands impressive interpretation will leave no one indifferent grabbing the audiences attention until the very end and elevating every single scene ciara bravo works beautifully as the female counterpart delivering a surprising performance in the end i do recommend it even though i expected a lot more from the people involved ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog charlie kaufman is undeniably one of the greatest writers of the 2000s being john malkovich and eternal sunshine of the spotless mind are some of his most notable works but its synecdoche new york thats considered by many as one of the best films of the respective decade therefore i was obviously excited about his return to liveaction movies since 2008 hes only made the animated feature anomalisa  im thinking of ending things boasts an incredibly talented cast capable of seating me down and make me watch any film they participate in even though jessie buckley dolittle is sort of a new face to me my expectations were moderately high so how did it go im not going to lie i found this movie so intricate that i had a really hard time figuring it all out as soon as it ended i knew i didnt understand it in full which generated an unusual yet refreshing feeling inside me i felt the need to not only think about the film all night but since i didnt have the time to watch it again i returned to a few specific scenes in the next morning i also researched a bit and talked with a fellow critic to settle some of my minds internal debates i write this to imply that this is not an easy movie to decipher which will definitely throw some people off its a film that requires all of the viewers attention and selfquestioning capability otherwise things will get complicated as usual im not sharing any spoilers so ill keep my opinion about the storys multiple interpretations to the bare minimum of all the numerous ways of explaining this movie i found two either from jessie buckleys characters perspective or from jesse plemons i like both for different reasons in terms of logic which every viewer will struggle to find plemons character is the key to understand the remarkably complex multilayered narrative looking at the film from his perspective everything makes much more sense however its surprisingly from buckleys view that i find the movies message to be more interesting and likely to resonate with most people making an impactful move in life requires determination courage decisiveness moving to another country switching jobs ending a relationship all can be extremely demanding and psychologically painful im thinking of ending things brilliantly demonstrates how one can delay these actions sometimes indefinitely from the excruciatingly long car drives almost an hour of the runtime is spent inside the car listening to the main characters debating apparently random philosophical themes to the enigmatic transitions of time passing by kaufmans screenplay keeps transmitting a message of how people are stationary and time just keeps flowing this film takes ambiguousness and metaphoric filmmaking to a whole other level not only everything the viewer is seeing has in some shape or form a philosophical meaning but the dialogues between the main characters are themselves about cultural intellectual sophisticated matters some of these conversations have an eventual impact in the narrative or in the characters some just feel like kaufman needed to express his thoughts on several subjects with a runtime of slightly over two hours this movie overstays its welcome a bit due to the insistence in delivering repetitive similar scenes with the same goal the time shenanigans performed in the parents house is undoubtedly intriguing but its more distracting than helpful storywise having in mind the already puzzling narrative the confusion associated with understanding how time works only creates even more doubts it also deviates the viewers attention from the real focus which didnt help my first viewing in fact i was so concentrated trying to comprehend the purpose behind the oldyoung versions of the characters that i completely lost track of the runtime ultimately thinking the film was near its ending when it still had forty minutes to go theres a limit to how abstract and implicit a movie can be without becoming genuinely hard to understand and kaufman walks that threshold successful sometimes not that much in other moments nevertheless i can only share compliments from now on firstly the cast ive been in love with anything toni collette does since hereditary and once again shes weirdly captivating as an amusing yet disturbing mother david thewlis offers a subtler performance as well as jesse plemons even though the latter explodes with emotion in the third act however jessie buckley steals the spotlight in impeccable fashion like i mentioned in the beginning i know very little of her as an actress but ill make sure to add her to the list of actresses to follow closely with one of the biggest emotional ranges seen this year she delivers an incredibly captivating display one that should guarantee her name in future contenders list for the awards season from citing entire poems to fiercely debating any topic thrown at her by plemons her commitment to the role is palpable an astonishing performance that i will remember for a long time however its in the technical realm that this film achieves perfection without the shadow of a doubt this is the best movie of the year when it comes to the technical attributes until the date of this review obviously  almost every filmmaking element carries a tremendous impact in either the narrative or its characters the purposefully rough editing robert frazen adds to the perplexing atmosphere the lighting plus the production molly hughes and set design mattie siegal help identify where a particular event is happening the detailed costume design melissa toth and the impressive makeup are vital to the understanding of everything that occurs in the parents house the distinct cinematography ukasz al elevates every single action performed by the characters its a technically flawless film and i wouldnt be surprised to see it being nominated for several categories when the time comes im thinking of ending things might be a netflix original movie but it screams a24 all the way from the incredibly perplexing narrative told through bizarre storytelling to its distinctly unconventional technical characteristics charlie kaufman offers a remarkably complex film that can take different interpretations and may require more than one viewing  his insistence in transmitting one of the films messages through neverending philosophical conversations and confusing timebending distractions stretch the story to an unnecessary long runtime that hurts the overall piece nevertheless all messages are successfully delivered through an intriguing headscratching weirdly captivating story packed with cultural debates and unique characters an absolutely outstanding jessie buckley elevates every single line of dialogue showing tremendous emotional range but the impressively talented cast also improves the multilayered screenplay technically it is and it will remain as one of the best movies of the year every technical aspect is close to perfection and almost all have a massive impact on the story and how the viewer interprets it it will undoubtedly create a gap between critics and audiences since it has all the ingredients that usually place these groups at opposite extremes i can only recommend it to people who are able to dedicate their full attention to what theyre watching while being capable of selfquestioning its not your usual netflix flick to pop during tedious home tasks to help pass the time so make sure you know what youre getting into ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog  dont worry this is going to be a pretty vague review right now as im writing this sentence im still processing what i saw and how am i going to explain how i felt without spoiling a single tiny thing first of all its such a mix of feelings on one hand im extremely happy that i was lucky to be alive during this epic time and that i was able to follow these characters that i love and care about so much on the other hand im obviously sad that it finally reached the end of this hopefully first incredible saga there are no perfect films and one with so many heroes will always have struggles balancing it all infinity war already had this issue  however the russo brothers did everything they could to deliver a phenomenal story and they did i dont think this could have been any better its last hour exceeds any expectations its epic emotional actionheavy and it has one of my favorite shots in the entire history of cinema its pure magic and the vfx team will surely get an oscar for it the action reminded me of the biggest lord of the rings battles and it was impeccably filmed filled with riveting and chillinducing sequences nevertheless dont expect this highintensity feeling throughout the whole runtime the other two acts are a slowburn buildup to a payoff thats going to make you pretty much either love or like this movie i absolutely love it this is easily one of the best mcu films if not my new number one i cant deny that the 3hour runtime has some unnecessary scenes but even if they dont have a significant impact on the plot or even in the characters they still contribute to the enormous buildup seeing this family that we grew up with just talking with each other or having lunch at the same time that they deal with the consequences of thanos snap is inexplicably captivating and heartwarming characters like natasha scarlett johansson and steve chris evans supporting each other is simply beautiful their comradery and chemistry are worthy of some tears here and there some people didnt really enjoy infinity war so much due to the lack of screentime that some characters had this time around there are fewer characters to work with so the balance is better everyone gets an important role from captain america to antman paul rudd to nebula karen gillan  and even rocket bradley cooper  every single character has a major moment if you take one out of the movie it just doesnt work anymore this is not only great work from the directors but also from the writers christopher markus and stephen mcfeely are not even going to be remembered because fans will always think of the cast first most of them will also remember the directors but the writers if i stand at the door of the theater at the end of the film and question everyone about who are the writers i strongly believe most of the audience wont know every dialogue every sentence every word carries so much impact on the narrative literally i cried and got chills just by hearing two freaking words with the perfect timing in between the amount of grief that the words of the ones whove lost everyone and everything carry is palpable and for me those are the most emotional moments of the movie seeing how everyone is suffering from their own losses not the deaths themselves the humor is mostly onpoint but its still connected to my only real issue with the film which is the second acts tone from the moment the team decides what to do we already know that this is a 1 in 14 million chance of success like dr strange benedict cumberbatch said so the stakes and pressure are massive with this level of tension i didnt expect such an easygoing and funny vibe throughout except for one particular sequence they do a great job once again of pairing up certain avengers together but most of them go through these too comedic plot points for such a crucial and serious mission fortunately this act carries enough action and emotional drive to make this problem not that big of an issue visually this is arguably the bestlooking superhero film ever from the mindblowing visual effects to the gorgeous cinematography everything is perfect the costumes are gritty and muddy when our heroes are in a battle their faces are all filled with blood and i have no words to describe how jawdropping that last act is i cant wait to change my desktop wallpaper once that shot is available i dropped a single tear just by looking at it no one talks no one does anything its just an amazingly beautiful image the score is epic as hell so much that im listening to it right now as im writing this review and im getting chills all over my body i cant really write much more to be honest i will acknowledge the cast because they are brilliant each and every single member delivers an outstanding performance but if i had to choose the ones that both surprised me and had the most impact on me they would be johanssons evans and robert downey jrs tony stark iron man  new characters like captain marvel brie larson blend seamlessly and the payoff is unbelievably satisfying in terms of predictability it goes more or less as i expected but it still carries a few surprises throughout nothing is ever like we imagine or theorize about so expect the unexpected and dont judge a movie by if it fits your crazy unrealistic theories that never crossed the producers and directors minds in the first place all in all i dont know what to do now the only thing im sure of is that i want to see it again as soon as possible the last hour is f cking insane i couldnt fall asleep properly because i couldnt stop thinking about it endgame surpasses all expectations its everything i wished for and so much more i could easily spend a whole day at the movie theater and watch three sessions in a row its that good one of the best comicbook films of alltime without a single doubt thank you to kevin feige and everyone who worked hard to bring the mcu to where it stands now i cant even think of how are they going to produce something at the level of infinity saga maybe they never will maybe well have to wait another decade or two for something like this until then see you at the next endgame screening enjoy oh and dontspoiltheendgame ps its not a perfect movie i know it doesnt exist one yes endgame has some issues regarding its pacing and tone but i would be lying to myself if this isnt everything i dreamed of i felt the same way with civil war regarding the rating to give and i ended up giving it an a after a first viewing as soon as i watched the second time i changed it to an a  i dont need to wait for that second viewing with endgame and thank you to my audience for being incredibly respectful no yelling no crazy laughs no stupid people doing stupid stuff thank you so much for not ruining one of the best cinematic experiences of my life  ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog if youve been following me closely for the past week im currently re watching five of david finchers films in preparation for his next movie mank which premieres on netflix in a couple of weeks ive already revisited se7en and fight club two iconic films that not only profoundly impacted filmmaking but also our culture however zodiac isnt one of finchers most popular movies and maybe thats one of the reasons why im watching it for the very first time based on a real story finchers first nonfiction adaptation is also one of the longest films of his career i didnt know anything about the true events before watching this movie which leads me to the biggest compliment i can offer to this type of film there are hundreds of characteristics that a viewer can observe analyze and through them ultimately form an overall opinion about a movie nevertheless when it comes to cinematic adaptations of a true story theres always one aspect that i value tremendously which is how much the film convinces me to research about its story after i finish watching it truth is midway through zodiac i started to acknowledge its lengthy duration dont be mistaken its not what people call a slow movie much on the contrary its long yes but its packed with nonstop rapidfire dialogues that fincher himself asked the actors to speed up so that the runtime wouldnt stretch even more throughout the entire film i feel the exact same manner as the main characters for the first hour or so the case is ramping up the murders increase in quantity new developments emerge just like new suspects letters ciphers and everything that comes with dealing with this serial killer during this period i feel extremely captivated but then comes a phase where the characters themselves start to give up due to the lack of concrete evidence to finally convict a suspect i feel the frustration depression and even the infuriating absence of a clear path to the killer however robert graysmiths jake gyllenhaal obsession with the case starts becoming my own and the last thirty minutes are incredibly stressful frightful and enthusiastic zodiac possesses 157 minutes mostly consisting of talking and only a couple of stylish slowmotion murder scenes so obviously this is a dialoguedriven narrative james vanderbilts screenplay is packed with detailed characterization extensive conversations and from what i could gather an impressive historical accuracy fincher and vanderbilt prove their unbelievable commitment with the mindblowing preparation for this flick which basically included an entirely unique investigation on the real case interviewing the people who give life to the movies protagonists family members police departments witnesses etc  yet another evidence that supports the importance of the preproduction phase in filmmaking so in case i forget to answer my own question zodiac achieved its primary mission as soon as the film ended i found myself googling everything about the real case trying to find out new information obsessed with the intriguing story it doesnt even matter if the viewer loves the movie or not its impact is undeniable since most people will feel the same urgency to understand more about the real case two other attributes deeply contribute to this result the cast and the editing the latter is performed by angus wall and his work is some of the best film editing ive ever witnessed its the main reason why the huge runtime feels adequate and why the narrative moves so well no wonder almost every job of his got so many award nominations finally the actors are all extraordinary mark ruffalo dave toschi  anthony edwards bill armstrong  robert downey jr paul avery  and jake gyllenhaal portray distinct welldeveloped characters who deal with the case in their own way obsession is definitely the fundamental social theme present in the movie depicted differently with each character armstrong completely moves on and never looks back toschi tries to forget but he cant accept that he failed to do his job avery develops a mental condition and or addiction due to its inability to deal with the pressure stress and frustration of reporting the case graysmith lets his total obsession over zodiac impact his personal life affecting his family in the process fincher is able to represent each and every one of these behaviors in an astonishingly realistic fashion the use of long uninterrupted takes helps the conversations flow better and the simple nondistracting camera work from harry savides lets the viewer focus on who theyre listening to its one of those films which i cant really point out direct flaws theres that period during the second act where i start to feel tired and worn out and despite the irreprehensible dedication to providing every single bit of knowledge about the actual events its still an enormous amount of information to process which made me feel a bit lost occasionally fortunately the movie ends strongly culminating in a simple yet powerful exchange of looks all in all zodiac gains the most generous praise that a film based on a true story can ever receive from me james vanderbilts screenplay convinced me to research everything about the real events as soon as the movie finished which is undeniably an impactful effect of watching such a wellwritten captivating narrative with welldeveloped authentic characters david finchers commitment to being as historically accurate as possible is visible onscreen a remarkable result of a massive preparation that very few filmmakers would even think about performing with some of the best editing work in the history of cinema the lengthy runtime flows better than expected but the amount of information to digest is overwhelming and tiresome dropping the levels of entertainment especially during a certain period of the second act nevertheless a phenomenal third act three outstanding performances from mark ruffalo robert downey jr and jake gyllenhaal and an emotionally compelling realistic approach to extreme obsession turn the entire film into one of the best of its genre another massive recommendation from this side ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog when it comes to horror im always willing to give any film a shot even when everything indicates its probably going to be a massive failure im admittedly not a saw fanatic despite quite enjoying the first two movies after these i cant even remember which installments i actually watched or not not even the most recent jigsaw caught my attention in preparation for spiral i tried to determine precisely how it would be placed in the sagas timeline which proved to be a surprisingly challenging task basically what matters for this film is that john walker tobin bell and his work as the jigsaw serial killer are acknowledged making this a sequel with that said unfortunately spiral doesnt change my opinion about the franchise its a formuladriven saga that no one really cares about too much anymore in fact im pretty shocked by the fact that this installment was even greenlit having in mind the particularly sensitive times our society lives in countless movies and tv shows are held to stricter standards nowadays with the risk of getting canceled or boycotted if a certain subject is treated poorly with so much gratuitous violence its surprising to see this franchise still alive boasting curious casting choices  chris rock leading a horror flick is definitely an attentiongrabber  the extremely bloody gory trap killings are packed with lifeordeath dilemmas as always which will surely please hardcore fans however these are just not as captivating or fun as before this movie doesnt possess a single memorable trap that surpasses any of the dozens hundreds from before just like josh stolberg and peter goldfingers screenplay its just another lazy unsurprising variation of a wellknown formula to be fair and im trusting other critics who watched all of the other installments this is supposedly the version that separates the most from the structure people first witnessed in 2004 and 2005 still being different doesnt mean better and the competition isnt exactly defined by masterpieces from my perspective spiral is just another generic take on an overdone story from the repetitively identical kidnapping sequences to the consequent traps the potential of a great film depended on how darren lynn bousman saw ii iii iv and the duo of writers tackled the characters mainly the protagonist the lack of characterization is definitely a problem but the baffling laziness in storytelling ruins the entire flow of the movie with an overwhelming amount of flashbacks and an incredibly choppy annoying editing work dev singh  the nonstop heightened super tense atmosphere transforms every single scene like its the most crucial moment of the film consequently a vast majority of the dialogues are characters screaming and cursing at each other in almost every interaction the outofcontrol tone negatively affects the casts performances many people will look at chris rock dolemite is my name madagascar and believe hes delivering an overthetop display but hes just following the chaotic environment established by the director during the first minutes of the movie rock is amusing and funny as expected but hes also able to tap his more dramatic side however when every single line of dialogue needs to be interpreted as if its the most vital part of the film very few actors can pull it off samuel l jackson glass spiderman far from home is one of them but his expectedly short screentime doesnt allow for much entertainment though its always special seeing slj cursing at someone finally saw is also about finding out who is responsible for the disgusting game and spiral doesnt remove that essential block of narrative the issue here is the lack of a jawdropping revelation obviously this is as subjective as everything you just read until now but i would be astonished if most viewers didnt guess who the new jigsaw copycat is during the first act i do want to end on a positive note so ill compliment the bold ending it partially holds the studio against the wall in the sense that the probability of this movie getting a sequel being higher which can make some viewers think its too forced i rather believe they just wanted to have an intense finale which i cant really deny spiral might offer enough blood gore and brutal traps murders to fans of the franchise but overall its still just another lazy predictable take on the saw formula despite the violently captivating lifeordeath sequences none stands out as an unforgettable moment josh stolberg and peter goldfingers screenplay lacks efficient character development impactful revelations and honestly a massive amount of creativity from the repetitively tiresome flashbacks and kidnapping scenes to the extremely outofcontrol tone darren lynn bousman isnt able to take the story to its potential everything is dialed up to its maximum as if every single line of dialogue needs to be screamed from the top of a mountain which transforms the entire atmosphere into a chaotic environment chris rock cant be the only one to blame for his overtense line deliveries especially when he starts so well a strong yet abrupt ending doesnt compensate for such dull storytelling i wish i could write that im disappointed but i didnt have high expectations for this one  ",

couldnt hide from the negative feedback that social media was presenting people online were skeptical of how good will smiths genie would be of how mena massoud aladdin and naomi scott jasmine were not the best casting choices and of how the remake would actually honor and respect its original from someone who didnt know what to expect i thoroughly enjoyed guy ritchies take on the retelling of this famous story all of the fears described above are obliterated by a magical cast and theyre the ones who carry the movie to safe harbor ill start with one out of two standout performances will smith as the genie he delivers an indisputably unique and entertaining display as the blue entity by the way he moves and talks theres absolutely no way of people criticizing him for trying to copy robin williams smith does his own thing and it works superbly the best compliment i can give him is that i felt the same thing about genie in this remake that i did while watching the original every time he wasnt on screen i wanted him to be back immediately in the original i thought that the genie appeared in the right moments every single time which was when the pacing started to drop too much in this remake the periods without genie are more extended and the first act suffers a bit from its slow pace and lack of truly fun sequences nevertheless once the cave of wonders comes into play its a blast until the very end the magic carpet and abu make one hell of a comedy duo and theyre responsible for a lot of the laughs throughout the runtime going back to genie i love that ritchie and john august gave him something more in comparison with the original and thats one of few improvements actually made to the original i wrote on that review that i was hoping that they gave more time for the core relationship of the film to develop and that jafar marwan kenzari was more than just a paperthin villain well jafar keeps being an evil sorcerer that only desires power to rule everything and everyone unfortunately he has more screentime than its predecessor which means more overthetop monologues of kenzari and sillier sequences with the whole hypnosis trick on the other hand jasmine and aladdin have a fullydeveloped script which is by far the best improvement on the original their relationship grows naturally and each character gets a lot of moments to express their feelings and show who they truly are especially jasmine she is directly connected to an issue that will definitely make this movie incredibly divisive audience and critics alike but ill address it more at the end of the review independently of the characters mena massoud and naomi scott deliver breakthrough performances massoud is funny and quite likable as aladdin but naomi is an absolute standout now we look at this film as just another disney remake in a few years well look at aladdin 2019 as the movie that launched naomi scott into the stardom she is astonishingly outstanding as jasmine not only her voice is pretty amazing but her acting is unbelievably seamless regarding singing will smith and mena massoud are also pretty good and the musical numbers are another aspect that i surprisingly loved prince ali friend like me a whole new world and the new song speechless are beautiful powerful and the first twos production design and vfx are overwhelming in a good way guy ritchie is known for his very fluid chasing sequences and aladdin running through agrabah is very well filmed as expected however the long choreographed takes during these musical scenes are a wonder to behold from the first to the very last one even after the the end tagline shows up a perfect remake is one that is able to keep the originals essence while being its own thing ritchie does an impressive job balancing these pillars for anyone who loves the original and wanted the remake to be a shotbyshot retell of the story every single little detail from key words to important character moments is present in this film for anyone who wanted a different take theres more than enough minor changes to either how the story proceeds order of events more character development or even how it ends which leads me to the abovementioned divisive issue every time a political or social agenda is inserted in a movie people dont care if its wellwritten or not they just dont want any of those things on any film and i support that hollywood needs to stop trying to put something politically or socially correct in a movie just for the sake of it aladdin 2019 has a clear social message and it uses one of the main characters to state that message clearly now heres the catch having in mind the character in question how its written and what they do to send that social message i think its fine yes i know that a lot of people will think the complete opposite and crucify the film for it i usually do the following mental exercise does it make sense with the story character is it just a single moment during the movie proving that it might be too forced or do they develop the idea if it was an original film would i even be thinking about this yes they develop the idea probably not those are my answers and thats why i stand on the positive side of this soontobe heavily discussed subject during a few days people need to start opening their minds to these modern takes on pre21stcentury classics i always use dumbo 1941 as an example this is probably the most racist disney movie ever with extreme discrimination total disrespect for animals alcoholinduced plot points and so much more morally and socially wrong storylines and characters personalities theres no way that a film like that can be released today so obviously dumbo 2019 had to be extremely different from that onehour racism show aladdin 1992 also has a particular aspect about it that it doesnt quite fit nowadays culture its not offensive or anything but i bet that if it was released today a whole group of people would complain about it aladdin 2019 tries to adapt and while it might have tried too hard i still appreciate the effort and at least it makes sense its only a minor change to the core story and to the character in question so it shouldnt affect the overall viewing of the movie if speechless wasnt created it would have been totally fine but i have to admit that even if the song sounds great and the lyrics are impactful its still a stretch naomi scott interprets it beautifully though visually the film is stunning agrabah is an absolute delight that will make hardcore fans jaws drop continuously each time a new location is shown i love how ritchie strolls the camera around to showoff his production crew beautiful work most of the times through long and fluid takes i wish no pun intended he could have controlled the movies pace and tone better periods without genie to entertain the audience are too long and ritchie shouldnt risk the boredom levels to be as high as they are occasionally all in all aladdin 2019 succeeds in balancing the two pillars of any remake it keeps the originals true essence while standing on its own will smith shuts down online skeptics with a super entertaining and unique performance as genie but its naomi scott and mena massoud palpable chemistry that surprised the hell out of me the latter is perfect as aladdin but naomi has her breakthrough display which is definitely going to take her to even bigger stages guy ritchie proves hes a fantastic director by delivering some beautiful onetake sequences and exceptionally fun and wellchoreographed musical numbers technically the production and set design are astounding but the pacingtone levels arent as balanced as they should have been which makes the runtime overextend itself storywise people will feel incredibly divisive most of the screenplay is identical to its predecessor but disneys attempt to force down a social message is not going to help the film at all even if it makes sense and its only a minor twist it was still unnecessary and it might even shadow naomis brilliant performance which would be a massive shame jafar bothers me a lot more than any of

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog since wonder woman that the dceu has not missed a beat even though the latter is still my favorite of the universe i have mostly a positive opinion about justice league aquaman and shazam yes these are not the greatest comicbook movies of alltime but i would be lying if i denied that i was entertained birds of prey follows the same path its fun actionheavy and it boasts a phenomenal cast it has some issues regarding the actual plot and a few characters but ill get there first of all let me get the mandatory compliments to margot robbies performance out of the way if theres a dc character better than harley quinn for robbie to portray please let me know because i think shes absolutely perfect as a lunatic overthetop psychiatristturnedpsychopath suicide squad might be a total mess but i doubt anyone denies how robbie fits seamlessly into the harley persona from her looks to the way she speaks and from her physical movement to her facial expressions theres just no better casting she embodies the whole films chaotic vibe and even contributes to the very colorful set design however shes not the only one who delivers a spectacular performance jurnee smollettbell offers a surprisingly captivating display as dinah lance black canary even though harley quinn is the main character i found myself caring a lot about dinah her way of living suits the characters personality like a glove and shes undoubtedly the bestwritten secondary character of the movie unfortunately i cant say the same about the others and this is one of my biggest issues its a film packed with cliches and attempts of making the characters aware of those cliches which is also well something pretty overused whats more generic having the bad guy telling the hero their masterplan or having the hero stating how the bad guy is incredibly dumb by thinking of doing that at first i laughed and i thought it was funny the way christina hodson was avoiding to write straightup cliche characters by making everyone else aware of the way these talk or move but the whole i know youre cliche so you can get away with saying or doing cliche things only works for a couple of scenes not an entire movie this is why i wasnt able to connect with renee montoya or care about her narrative at all mary elizabeth winstead is one of my favorite actresses but she has the least screentime of the entire cast i never criticize a film for not giving an actor actress i like a more important role unlike other people i believe it would be unfair to do so  still i do complain if i think a particular character should have been given more screentime which is the case of huntress i find her backstory way more exciting and emotionally investing than rosie perezs character but sadly huntress personal story serves only as a notthatsurprising third act twist there are several pastpresent transitions in the storytelling most work but some feel extremely abrupt nevertheless winstead is outstanding every single time shes on camera ewan mcgregor offers a good performance as the villain but he leads me to my other major issue the central plot trivia time a macguffin is an object device or event necessary to the narrative and the motivation of the characters but insignificant unimportant or irrelevant in itself the thread that connects every single character is based on one of the most overused macguffins ever now dont get me wrong a macguffin is not a synonym of bad writing or of a bad plot its merely something that leads to nothing having in mind that birds of prey is a characterdriven movie a plot centered around a macguffin is not unusual as long as every character works the primary story can simply be a passenger quentin tarantinos once upon a time in hollywood applies this method  however in birds of prey not every character has an interesting story basically christina hodsons screenplay isnt exactly bad but it isnt great too just like the film it has its ups and downs and i saved some of the ups for last because i do want to end this review on a positive note finally a dceu movie where the action isnt overwhelmed with cgi but with detailed choreography and long takes instead thank you cathy yan for bringing some of the best action sequences in this universe even if the third act gets a little sloppy due to the amount of characters its still a very satisfying ending the score beautifully accompanies the action and the visuals are truly gorgeous to look at the comedy bits are onpoint i laughed quite often but my final remark goes to a topic i rarely address birds of prey is a filmmaking lesson on how to produce an incredibly diverse movie without it feeling forced or unnatural only after leaving the theater i acknowledged the fact that the cast and characters are from various races cultures and have different sexual preferences why because this film doesnt waste its runtime by having its characters mention how black white latinas chinese gay or whatever they are they simply are what they are and we all have eyes to see them congrats to yan hodson and everyone else who decided to treat the characters as if theyre humans like every one of us in the end birds of prey and the ridiculously long subtitle continues dceus streak of at least good movies since wonder woman came out with a phenomenal cast led by an outstanding margot robbie as harley quinn cathy yan delivers some of the best action of the entire universe in a genuinely entertaining superhero flick a colorful chaotic and fun vibe is present throughout the whole runtime as well as a pretty neat score however christina hodsons screenplay lacks creativity the main plot revolves around the most overused macguffin ever and some characters are straightup taken from the book of cliches its a generic comicbook film with a formulaic narrative but one that possesses enough fun and entertainment to overlook the typical story ",

well the story might follow the same essential plot points and the characters might have similar narrative paths but there are so many details that make this movie stand on its own from tiny little improvements to moments of the original that wouldnt make sense in a realistic environment to adjustments to characters backstory musical moments or other significant parts with that said i need to discuss the controversy surrounding this remake but i wont take longer than one paragraph people need to understand that these disneys remakes arent here to replace the originals theyre here to honor them and bring their stories and characters to this new century so that new generations can have an additional look at something they love and 90s kids can remember why they love these films so much emphasis on the additional part of that sentence then people also need to get their preferences right would you want to watch a shotforshot remake or something entirely different or a blend of these two if you dont know what you want you might be in danger of turning into a hypocrite if your speech goes from i dont want these copypaste remakes to they changed that specific moment why didnt they keep it the same just be clear on what you wish if you simply dont want disney to do these remakes then just dont watch them dont go online try to beat it to the ground with negative comments if you havent seen the movie moving on i love it i absolutely love it i cried the exact same 4 times as i did in the 1994s original my whole body got chills during the opening sequence which is one of a few things i love more about the remake than in the original its not a shotforshot remake i dont understand how so many critics are calling it so either peoples memory of the original faded or someone clearly didnt watch the same film i can write a whole review of 1000 words just describing the new stuff of course the story goes through the same iconic moments in the same way and some dialogues are extensively repeated which was something that i was hoping they developed more despite that i still feel that the scripts have a different take on it from the voice actors even james earl jones one proof would be that i cried on a scene that i never felt like it in the original i dont know if it was how it was shot one of the various different angles that the remake provides of known scenes or if the dialogue just has more impact this time around but the point here is that this remake is not a cheap copypaste i always look forward to seeing what they come up with to solve or adjust some questions that the originals leave us with let me just write that jeff nathanson has some truly brilliant changes additions remember people criticizing scars look when the first teaser came out with just one word its entire physical shape scar and past are explained one word imagine that there are little elements like adding a word or a sentence here and there and it makes so much more sense with the character or the story in question speaking of scar chiwetel ejiofor is astonishing scar might be my favorite character of the remake hes more menacing and scarier his voice is darker and his arc is better explored jeremy irons will always have that iconic voice associated with the character but ejiofor did a crazily good job in replacing him however if theres one voice that i could never watch another actor do is mufasas i have no words to express how emotionally powerful james earl jones voice is as soon as he says simba in the reflection scene my eyes drop waterfalls his voice is an emotional trigger lets call it that i love timon billy eichner and pumbaa seth rogen even more this time around their scenes are hilarious and the characters relationship keeps being a standout oh and if you were worried that the hula scene would never be as good let alone surpassed you might need to rethink that also i enjoyed the stretched last act i found the originals final battle too abrupt  and i would advise parents to be careful showing this remake to very young kids since the violence on display feels much more real duh  jd mccrary and shahadi wrightjoseph young nala are amazing and their voices are crystal clear while singing donald glover and beyonc adult nala are also terrific and their voices are even better the new music spirit fits better in this remake than speechless in aladdin moving on to the music its another aspect that i genuinely think the remake does better hans zimmer proves that he can bring an old score of his back to life in a much more robust epic and passionate way every song feels more prominent every soundtrack feels a lot more impactful and stronger be prepared is the only one that goes through a significant change and while it might sound a bit strange at first i love it more each time i listen to it its a score that will never be forgotten and this remake just helped people remember how great it is oscarwinning score i left the best to last the visuals i cant possibly describe how impressive and eyegasmic the cgi is animals talking was never an issue people keep sharing gifs or short clips and immediately started complaining that it looked awkward a 30seconds video without context watched on a laptop will never give you a hint of how the movie will actually be  yes the expressiveness of the original animation cant be achieved but going as far as saying that the film lacks soul or that the characters dont emote is just inaccurate you dont need a phd to understand that a lion with its ears down or up means different things there are tiny little movements in the animals that are so complex that im still astounded how they were able to do it if a bug flies near their faces they flinch or move in such a characteristic way that i felt like i was truly watching real animals once again oscarwinning vfx i dont really have major problems with it minor gripes with a few things but the biggest one would be the lack of more uniqueness theres no element of surprise in regards to the story or the characters decisions we always know whats coming so were prepared no pun intended for anything they through at us because well weve seen it before with the exception of one particular scene that made me jump out of my chair and i think not a single person will be able to avoid it  i find the animals dont emote argument one of the biggest nitpicks in the history of cinema it might be true that they lack the emotion of the original animation but going as far as saying that they show absolutely no emotion is just hating for the sake of hate same goes for people criticizing the fact that can you feel the love tonight is sung during broad daylight in the original it isnt nighttime as well finally i just want to address the these remakes arent necessary no one asked for these discussion no one asked for the 1994s movie until it came out people didnt know they needed it seriously everyone needs to realize that these remakes arent here to replace the originals how many of you have watched the lion king 1994 or showed it to someone in the past 10 years how many times have you heard its score in the same period i bet that most of the answers are simply none thats how important this remake is then it makes you go back it makes everyone remember how incredible the 1994s film is by keeping its essence while being able to stand on its own jon favreau did a tremendous job and i hope he gets recognized for it in the end it doesnt matter if the story is identical if we cry all the same it doesnt matter if we know whats coming if we still feel nervous and worried about the characters the lion king 2019 is one of disneys best remakes so far on par with the jungle book its vfx are gamechanging its score is more powerful and emotional than in the original and the story carries the same heartfelt impact james earl jones voice is everything timon and pumbaa are even funnier ejiofors scar is the best character in this remake i have no flaws to point out except that it follows the exact same path that the originals story does i wish it would be more distinct but i cant lie to myself i love it deeply one of 2019s best movies my 1 spot will be hard to decide go watch it i cant wait to see it again ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my reviews please follow my blog  first of all this is obviously a spoiler review i mean who hasnt seen this movie yet if by some extraordinary circumstances youre one of those unlucky souls stop spend the next hour and a half watching this animated masterpiece and come back here i will still avoid mentioning key details because im just used to it and the lion king has so many things to compliment that i dont really need to get indepth on spoilers so in case you havent notice it through my twitter or occasional mentions in other reviews the lion king is one of my favorite films of alltime animated or not  i rewatched it for the 312358th time this last weekend and i cried more than when i was just a child thats how much this movie means to me the sense of nostalgia plus the overwhelming emotions throughout the runtime are tearinducing aspects that i cant simply avoid i literally cried waterfalls in four  different scenes the opening sequence circle of life filled my eyes with nostalgias tears mufasas tragic moment obviously wrecked me one of the most emotionally powerful scenes in the history of cinema  simba receiving the whole remember who you are speech from mufasa in the clouds is incredibly inspirational and therefore worthy of some sobbing finally one of the last scenes simba climbing his way to the top of pride rock with hans zimmers score leaving me absolutely destroyed and i want to pick up on that last aspect the score its one of the most crucial technical features of a film in my opinion it can transform an okay scene into something magical or something pretty terrible depending on what kind of score it is consequently it can make a good movie turn into a great one hans zimmer is one of my favorite composers ever his soundtracks are always filled with such an epic vibe even if the film itself isnt that good his scores are still able to elevate it in some way the lion king is one of his most memorable scores due to how emotionally compelling it is even in the subtlest moments during the stampede sequence the score doesnt lend you time to breathe its high rhythm and continuously growing music keep any viewer at the edge of the seat waiting for it to be over then when simba descends and approaches his dad the score is so subtle completely opposite to the previous sumptuous and grand sound its that nuance plus the impact of the scene itself that make me cry in the last scene that i mentioned above its solely the score that brings in the chillinducing tears if simba climbed pride rock with no soundtrack it would just be a good ending however from the exact moment that the score fades in it instantly turns that sequence into an epic finale the slowmotion walk to the top the immersive score simbas roar damn it im crying again the animation is some of disneys best its not by chance that the disney renaissance era 19891999  which was the return to form by disney has the best animation quality of its history and a lot of the memorable movies that marked everyones childhood its expressiveness and ease to make animals emote elevates the story and its characters theres no need for any kind of dialogue when you can see how the characters are reacting and understand what theyre feeling the wide shots are beautiful to look at and worthy of being anyones wallpaper even today the songs are remarkable and they influenced an entire generation can you feel the love tonight circle of life be prepared hakuna matata every single song is someones favorite the voice work is perfect james earl jones gives such an outstanding vocal performance that even when discussing his careers biggest role darth vader isnt the obvious choice jeremy irons and his raspy voice elevate scar as the villainous character if you close your eyes and only hear every characters voice without having watched the film previously you can easily identify whos the bad guy and thats unbelievably good everyone else is amazing but these two gentlemen are astonishing and they deserve to be remembered forever as the voices of these iconic roles nevertheless in the end the two pillars of every movie always matter the most story and characters the lion king has an especially compelling screenplay one that teaches its viewers how to handle loss but also how to grow up and overcome our worst fears its true that most people cry watching this film but those same people are filled with joy by the end because they accompanied simbas journey from being a reckless and innocent cub to becoming the king that everyone needed while also making his father extremely proud even though its a very tragic movie timon and pumbaa are two hilarious characters that keep bringing some sense of happiness by delivering some wellneeded laughs their laidback lifestyle is something that everyone desires but when you have responsibilities you cant just hide from them you must learn how to be what everyone needs you to be without losing the essence of who you are its a masterpiece it doesnt matter if its an animated film it doesnt matter if it was made for kids people need to stop looking at animated flicks as something juvenile that only children can watch while parents can do something else if parents watched this kind of inspirational animated movies as well maybe the world would be a better place the lion king is one of my favorite films of alltime and its undeniably one of disneys best original movies from the gorgeous animation to the beautiful score from the emotionally compelling story to the life journey simba goes through from the chillinducing tearful moments to the loud laughs the lion king is just perfect hopefully its liveaction remake will keep its essence and deliver these feelings once again  ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog  with doctor sleep an almost 40year sequel to the shining being released this week now its the perfect time to revisit one of the greatest horror movies of alltime as well as one of the most influential directors ever stanley kubrick i know i know spoilerfree for a movie released in 1980 well first of all theres always someone who still didnt watch it secondly as deeper we get into the 21st century the more the 60s 70s 80s 90s movies are forgotten and finally if theres a movie which i dont need spoilers to explain how outstanding it is its the shining with that said it has always been one of my favorite horror films ever its not perfect no film is and some aspects dont work as well now as they did 5 10 20 years ago when it came out kubricks adaptation of stephen kings novel was received with mixed reactions king himself criticized the movie however less than 10 years later kubricks film was already being reevaluated nowadays its considered a cult classic and its easy to understand why from the countless homages to the hundreds of comedic parodies the shining has some of the most memorable lines ever just this year we had it chapter two mimicking jack nicholsons heres johnny scene for example and then theres the mysterious redrum however the movies biggest influence is its technical achievements i apologize in advance if this review becomes too technical but its impossible not to address the arguably best component of the film this movie was one of the first to use steadicam a camera stabilizer mount which allows for smooth shots even on irregular surfaces isolating the operators movement  something that became so common that people dont even praise anymore honestly there are still a bunch of recent movies that have terrible camera work so im one of those who defend that the steadicam use shouldnt be taken for granted especially how kubrick did barely above the floor which originated the extension lowmode that now exists and allows for the operator to easily shoot lower than its waist with the innovative use of the technical equipment kubricks delivers a masterclass in framing composing the visual content of a series of frames as seen from a point of view  so much that it became worthy of studying almost every shot in this movie has a visual clue or an underlying theme if you ever feel bored during your viewing then youre probably not watching it right youre not truly thinking about it or looking around the characters this isnt a generic horror flick with monsters or demons jump scaring you its heavy on visual storytelling so if you dont pay attention youre going to reach the films climactic and enigmatic ending and feel that you missed something from the miseenscene arrangement of everything that appears in the framing hence this french term that means placing on stage having several bloodred colors to the wide shots clearly showing exit signs and giving the mazevibe of the enormous hotel the imminent danger is visually spread out across the movie the symmetry mirroring is absolutely crucial to not only deliver key plot points but to create this sense of reality vs fantasy from the hotels structure and decoration everything is incredibly symmetric to the growing use of mirrors these are heavily used to either literally translate words or to show the descent into madness  kubricks framing is what leaves viewers scratching their heads still to this date youll always find something new on another viewing it might be from 1980 but its a movie that requires your full attention dont underestimate films from the 20th century like you cant be surprised by a film that old youll be dumbfounded by dozens  if john alcotts cinematography is impressive then what can i write about wendy carlos and rachel elkinds haunting score nowadays scores are more based on creating an emotional impact on specific moments however throughout the film and during dialogues even epic films still have a subtlest approach to these scenes and the music is either very quiet or completely inexistent in the shining the score is part of the conversation if a character feels fear or danger is imminent a simple heartbeat can elevate such a moment if two characters gradually turn their dialogue into something more violent and aggressive the music makes sure to accompany that descent into craziness its a perfect horror films score technically ill stop there because no words will be able to express how mindblowing kubricks visionary methods are hes one of the greatest directors ever maybe even the most influential hopefully his work will always be remembered and never stop being relevant storywise the shining also inspired a whole new generation everyone knows and loves the key moments of the film but its the clever exposition that satisfies me every piece of information is given through either an incredibly captivating dialogue or visual clues actions i watched the 144min version of the film the european version has 25min less than the american version and the latter has a final scene at a hospital edited out by kubrick himself  and pretty much every single scene is intended to mean something it can be important new information or an update on a previous plot point but every single sequence has a particular purpose jack nicholson commands the screen with a phenomenal performance one of his careers best his script might be very wellwritten but his delivery and commitment to the role are astonishing he carries onetake extense dialogues seamlessly credit to kubrick for making a movie with at least 2 3minute takes sure but nicholson is able to transform a good scene into a fantastic one danny lloyd delivers one of my favorite young performances ever his voice as tony is a great accomplishment and he seems to understand his surroundings in a way that i never felt like i needed to go easy on him because hes just impeccable shelley duvall however is a mixed bag for me overthetop displays were better received at the time but almost 40 years later her performance does reach an unbearable level a few times shes an amazing counterpart for nicholson and she stands her own within their dialogues but when shes alone or in an emotionally troubled moment shes too much to handle scatman crothers doesnt have that much screentime as dick halloran but he shines every time he has to deliver a line some people complain about the slow pacing but i love how it helps elevate the suspense and building up moments of immense tension while the ending might be just a tad abrupt the final image of the film stays with us forever and after all this time i still didnt settle on my own theory all in all the shining might be one of the most accessible classics to new viewers of today to understand why it is in fact one of the greatest and most influential horror films of alltime stanley kubricks masterclass in framing with his play on symmetry and mirrors is evident so even if you dont study the art of filmmaking its clear that these two themes are vital to telling the story in addition to his framing his use of the innovative steadicam and his notable miseenscene shaped an entire new generation that never misses a chance of paying homage to his work besides the impressive technical achievements jack nicholson delivers a memorably haunting performance the ending is still mindblowing after all these years and new theories keep coming up while ill keep trying to settle on my own interpretation dont you dare spend the rest of your life without re watching this cult classic  ",

are breaking down parasite at such a deep level that i cant really write anything new nevertheless ill share my thoughts on it because it would be a massive miss from someone who considers himself as a film critic i had this movie on my watchlist since last summer but i kept delaying it underestimating my time so no im not just watching parasite because it won best picture at the oscars i always planned on it in addition to that yes i also love it like most people and no im not writing this because im following the pack bong joon ho simply delivered one of 2019s best films and its definitely cracking a spot in my top10 i really enjoyed what bong did with okja and im a massive fan of snowpiercer therefore this isnt just another south korean flick its directed and cowritten by someone who has been proving himself for quite some time even though i still defend that sam mendes deserved to win best director for his work on 1917 im more than happy that a foreign movie finally won best picture and what a film to do it it can be described as a dark dramedy but i think social satire is more adequate the differences between the rich and the poor are beautifully shown onscreen exclusively through visuals theres so little exposition which is one of the reasons why parasite has one of 2019s best screenplays the balance between explaining something and leaving it ambiguous is perfect throughout the runtime bong joon ho leans on an actors face so that the audience can understand what that character is feeling through its expressions which will explain its actions later on theres a sequence that surely has been heavily discussed for the past months its raining and bong cleverly divides the screen with how the wealthy family is dealing with it against the poor neighborhood where the kim family comes from the gorgeous cinematography the unforgettable musical score the seamless editing everything about this sequence is technically flawless and it carries such an emotionally powerful message something astonishing and beautiful to look at for some can be a horrible disaster for others its a movie that balances a lot of tones in ten minutes the tone goes from funny to dramatic to suspenseful to scary to absolute tragedy and it all feels incredibly realistic thats one of my major compliments to parasite i never felt like it was fiction i never thought this is too much this would never occur even in the third act where the narrative takes some bold decisions everything makes sense with what had been shown until then from shocking character actions to surprising plot points bong and han jinwons screenplay is excellent everyone in the cast is fantastic but song kangho is the standout in my opinion his role as the father of the kim family is brilliant im actually surprised he wasnt nominated for best actor in more award shows i created a connection with this family in such a way that the ending truly impacted me its tough to deny that the writing is what makes parasite the phenomenon that so many people fell in love with myself included technically i dont have any defects to point out its one of those films that i firmly believe in having virtually no flaws im in love with the score i gasped several times at the impressive cinematography and the editing is perfect whatever genre the story decides to go to its always entertaining and extremely captivating its comedy is very smart and it made me laugh a lot of times its dramatic storylines kept my eyes always focused on what was happening even when it briefly delves into the horror territory its more suspenseful and scary than most of that genres flicks nowadays all in all parasite genuinely surprised me with so many people hyping it to a ridiculously high level my expectations were very moderate nevertheless i love it as much or more as everyone else i know that watching it this late can make some people question my opinion rating but i would never love a movie because i should or because other people do it deserves every award it received especially the ones concerning the screenplay its one of the best original stories of the last few years and its written in such a brilliant manner with beautiful visual storytelling instead of the overused exposition an emotionally resonant message is present throughout the whole runtime and the various tones are balanced seamlessly technically flawless cinematography score editing everythings absolutely perfect nothing is placed without purpose not a single line of dialogue is wasted bong joon ho is a phenomenal filmmaker one that cares about the art and everything that comes with it he truly put his heart and soul into this and it would be a shame if anyone fails to watch this magnificent movie just because its in a foreign language please dont make such an awful mistake  ",

to see how a remake of a 60min film would develop obviously changes to the story not only will occur but they need to people have to stop desiring these liveaction remakes to be a literal copypaste of their originals and start being fair to these movies pure animation is different from liveaction and the latter provides a much more realistic environment than the former so its evident that every remake they produce will have some updates in the more silly aspects furthermore ive witnessed a couple of critics hating this dumbo hating calling it one of the worst films of the year now thats a strong feeling to have against a movie that improves so much regarding its original yes it has a bunch of narrative issues and the dialogues can be cringeworthy but hating this 2019 remake while defending the original as it was some kind of masterpiece is ridiculous complaining about the 2019s ending when the 1941s is absolutely inadmissible is being a hypocrite whining about dumbo not being 100 the star of the show when the original has the elephant discover his flight abilities four minutes before the end is dumb in addition to that this film runs for twice the originals runtime what did you expect that human characters wouldnt be a necessary modification some critics are even complaining about animal abuse or their unnecessary exploration are they joking have they seen the original do they remember how racist it was how discrimination was treated as comedy even alcohol was handled as a plot point for gods sake 2019s dumbo barely has any animal violence and its final message is against animal captivity or exploration so any person who criticizes this ending is either a despicable human being or not a fan of the original dumbo at all enough about those critics i feel sick just remembering what they wrote said unfortunately 2019s dumbo does have a lot of screenplay issues theres no way of denying it the human characters are filled with cliche storylines and childwritten dialogues i know that analyzing childrens acting is not exactly a fair critic but ive seen so many remarkable young actors nowadays who make nico parker and finley hobbins performances look not that good their scripts also dont help  the visual style characteristic of tim burton is definitely present even if its magic becomes overwhelming at times 1941s dumbo was very concentrated in one small location contrary to its 2019 remake where v a vandeveres park feels like disneyland the stiff dialogues dont help the movies pacing and its tone could be better balanced nevertheless just the opportunity to watch such a gorgeous magnificent and visually jawdropping liveaction elephant come to life is absolutely delightful and entertaining as hell when a character like dumbo makes you cry when hes crying makes you feel sad when hes feeling sad makes you happy when hes feeling happy thats when you know the visual effects team has reached a point where liveaction is pretty much reality the little elephant looks like an adorable little elephant i mean what better compliment can i give a liveaction character than it looks and feels real even with the issues mentioned above its still a heartfelt story filled with emotional moments and a wonderful message technically it might lack consistency and some overall quality but i end up enjoying myself experiencing dumbos pain happiness and his bond with the kids flourish is special colin farrell and eva green deliver good performances and their character arcs cliche as they may be still carry some efficiency theres a wrong vibe surrounding the word cliche like its a bad thing not at all something being cliche just means weve seen that before a lot of times it doesnt mean weve seen it performed better or worse dumbo is a remake of a very influential 1941 film so obviously cliches are a certainty its a disney tale after all in the end cliche as it might be 2019s dumbo improves on a lot of aspects of its predecessor i do believe these movies are almost incomparable since the dimension runtime and even the main plot are surprisingly or not different still not remembering or even acknowledging the original not only is an absolute flaw but it can ultimately make you a hypocrite so be careful with what you write say i understand a person not enjoying this film or not liking it as much as i did but if you hate  it you better give me good enough reasons dumbo is probably the most visually stunning and incredibly realistic liveaction character disney was able to produce so far this little elephant alone is worth the price of admission his arc is way bigger and complex than the one in the original which can either delight or disappoint you to me it not only worked but it finished strong and way better than the original its upsetting that the screenplay couldnt accompany burtons impressive visual style even if overwhelming at times as well as the human characters who feel a bit detached from the actual story to tell its still a good time at the movie theater so go see it ",

throughout the year 2019 on the other hand has been quite interesting most blockbusters have resonated with me and theyve been my favorite films to watch so far avengers endgame john wick chapter 3  parabellum us glass  additionally original lowbudget flicks have also caught my eye and ive been enjoying them as well even if theyre no masterpieces greta long shot  although i had some bad experiences as well dark phoenix hellboy godzilla king of the monsters  crawl which i honestly expected just to be a clichefilled silly horror movie joins this last group and its on par with long shot as the best surprise of 2019 until now first of all this is not a typical horror film at least having in mind the last few examples of the genre people might go in expecting something along the lines of annabelle comes home but with alligators so i might as well moderate those thoughts i wouldnt even place it in that genre even though disasterhorror isnt exactly a bad description its definitely a suspense movie almost like a survivalthriller haley and dave have to fight for their lives in a race against both a hurricane and fatal predators so i wouldnt generally put this in the horror genre moving on i love this type of films you know that suspenseful claustrophobic sequences straightforward plot and set in mostly just one location you might think that since its only one place to shoot and its such a simple concept its easier overall but it couldnt be more distant from the truth with highbudget multiplelocation movies directors and screenwriters can hide their technical flaws with tremendous vfx or huge set pieces in one location especially such a small one like a modest house theres no hiding if you want to deliver an entertaining and captivating story you have to write an enthralling screenplay if you want to provide scary and efficient jump scare scenes you need to show some creativity and prove youre a talented filmmaker alexandre aja who doesnt exactly has a remarkable filmography showcases that even with such a simplistic and short idea its possible to be as or more fun than a massive blockbuster less than 20 minutes into the film and were on theres enough backstory and characterization of the main protagonist for the audience to not only care about haley but understand what skills she has that will help her survive what comes next i love small details like zooming in on her locking a door closing a window moving a piece of furniture every shot has meaning because it will affect the plot later on aja is not shooting something just because and thats a skill that a lot of directors struggle to have nowadays since they feel that the runtime needs to be close to the twohour mark after so many dumb cliche and horribly performed jump scare sequences in previous horror flicks from this year i finally got to watch a movie where the director knows how to truly scare people and make them jump out of their chairs there are no loud soundtrack noises to make you screech there are no demons or monsters in front of the screen screaming like crazy i was at the edge of my seat for more than a couple of times and i genuinely got scared on some particular moments where the surprise factor aja doesnt follow the cheap timings of most horror scenes and the creativity behind the camera were top notch obviously the vfx and overall production design arent mindblowing the alligators look pretty real and that was the main goal so mission accomplished also being ratedr helps the film to deliver great alligator attacks with tons of blood and the injuries our characters have to deal with are pretty gnarly and disgusting thats a compliment  filming in water is extremely hard especially in such a confined space however aja and his crew were able to produce a movie where you can understand everything thats going on for the entire runtime kaya scodelario and barry pepper deliver great performances and show amazing chemistry their characters have enough development even if they dont have that imaginative scripts crawl is one of those films where i cant point out a preeminent issue with it because its good at every aspect i mean sure there are a couple of rare moments of extreme survival where we might think he she should be dead but its such a fun and entertaining time at the theater that we can let go of one or two overthetop scenes its not like the meg where every single moment is unrealistic as hell the success of the fictional part of a fiction movie depends on its realistic foundation and limits if these arent wellestablished then the film will be all over the place and its viewers wont know what to believe or not all in all crawl is one of 2019s best surprises and i definitely recommend to see it in theaters with compelling leads and a simple concept alexandre aja delivers an entertaining suspenseful claustrophobic and technically creative movie finally someone who knows how to handle a camera and provide genuinely scary jump scare sequences hopefully this can catapult kaya scodelario to grab a bigger role on a more impactful film i cant point out any flaws its simply a good movie with such a lowbudget give a chance to this one and watch it instead of a massive blockbuster that will probably leave you disappointed with the numerous cliches and the extreme focus on silly action or huge set pieces as a replacement for a good story good job paramount  ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog disney purchased pixar way back in 2006 and many incredible animated films have been released under both banners therefore its quite understandable that many people dont recognize the difference between walt disney animation studios and pixar itself the latter studio released two movies just last year onward soul  while the formers latest original film dates back to 2016s moana so there was a lot of anticipation for a new animated movie from the studio that gave us classics such as aladdin the lion king mulan and more recently the frozen saga with don hall big hero 6 and carlos l pez estrada blindspotting at the helm and adele lim crazy rich asians and qui nguyen featurefilm debut tackling the screenplay did they succeed in delivering a good film well if i must answer yes or no ill go with the first one lets start with the positives the one thing everyone expects from a disney animated movie is beautiful animation and raya and the last dragon features tons of gorgeous creative jawdropping sceneries the different lands that the story takes the viewers through look impressively realistic some of them clearly drawing inspiration from real asian places and culture the character drawings also look excellent even though theyre not too far from what weve seen from 3d animation in the last few years technically though my standout goes to james newton howards addictive chillinducing score from the emotional tracks to the riveting tones that elevate every action sequence its a score that ill struggle to get out of my head for the next couple of weeks especially its main theme in fact im actually listening to it while writing this review and im feeling full of energy the sound effects for the druun monsters are pretty eerie its hard not to feel the weight of their threatening presence but the inspirational tearinducing soundtracks leave me floored the action scenes are wonderfully shot and animated bringing high levels of entertainment and excitement to a partially adventuredriven narrative rayas sword fighting is indisputably the most captivating type of battle seen throughout the entire runtime storywise is where things get a little disappointing to be completely honest while the visuals share outstanding imagination and creativity adele lim and qui nguyens formulaic screenplay is much more straightforward and unsurprising than expected i knew raya and the last dragon wasnt going to deliver a groundbreaking narrative but a videogamestyle script is far from being a good alternative the third act tries to challenge its storys predictability with one little unexpected moment that i undoubtedly love but besides not changing the outcome predicted in the first ten minutes of the film it severely damages a secondary character regarding this last issue i cant deny that its my main problem with the movie but i would have to go into spoiler territory to fully explain it therefore ill only address the characters inconsistency which unfortunately affects the films primary message the main themes revolve around trust and how if we treat other people kindly theyll treat us in the same way a lovely note that parents will surely want to transmit to their kids without the shadow of a doubt however the character in question spends the movie not knowing where to stand constantly betraying everyone and even blaming others for something that same character triggered in the first place despite having a significantly negative impact on my enjoyment of the film the ending does work quite well and compensates for my problem with the said character kelly marie tran lends her voice to raya a protagonist easy to root for due to her clear motivations and important mission while awkwafina is very funny as sisu a goofy dragon with more depth than what the viewers might expect from the first impression everyone in the cast delivers extraordinary voice work and every character has some sort of captivating trait that makes the audience support them except for you know who having in mind that kids are indeed the target audience im positive all will feel delighted with this movie boasting a predominantly asian american cast all delivering exceptional voice work raya and the last dragon follows a partially disappointing formulaic narrative but compensates it with stunning animation a chillinducing score and quite a nice ending walt disney animation studios returns with an original story that lacks surprising elements lending all the creativity and imagination to its entertaining fastpaced adventure packed with undeniably impactful visuals and incredibly riveting action sequences despite a significant problem with an inconsistent character that profoundly affects my enjoyment of the film all other characters are extremely likable goofy and wellwritten a delightful message about trust and treating others kindly is ultimately welltransmitted to the viewers which i hope parents will show their kids final remark james newton howards score will not leave your minds for a long long time ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog ive watched some incredible films during my life some offered me a blast of pure entertainment others left me crying like a baby and dozens made me laugh uncontrollably nevertheless the most memorable movies are the ones that profoundly impact me emotionally either by remembering me of a past phase of my life or by possessing main characters who i can strongly relate to what might be just another film for most viewers can ultimately become a personal journey for other people in the audience which is how i partially experienced the father i didnt have massive expectations for the movie itself but i was curious to know how great anthony hopkins would be while the legendary actor is undoubtedly a notable standout florian zellers creative unconventional storytelling left me completely floored by the end of the film i felt emotionally drained of all my feelings and thoughts due to the increasingly heavier devastating narrative cowritten by zeller and christopher hampton adapted from the formers awardwinning play le p re this could have been yet another generic story about dementia but zellers brilliant storytelling places the viewer in the protagonists skin offering a terrifying viewpoint of the disease from the very first minute until the end the spectators accompany anthony an old man starting to lose track of reality through his own perspective i genuinely dont know if this sort of point of view has been depicted before particularly in the case of dementia but either way its a harrowing experience that will surely leave a vast majority of its viewers extremely captivated throughout the entire runtime watching anthony go through scenes that he wholly believes are indeed happening as he sees them is as attentiongrabbing as it is frustrating and sad once the audience gets to see how the same scenes really played out in fact if one starts watching the movie without even knowing the synopsis the first act will almost seem like a mysterythriller due to so many twists and turns regarding previous conversations that anthony and the viewers believe are 100 real zeller and hamptons script doesnt only approach anthonys feelings but also the loved ones surrounding him which i firmly believe was both necessary and honest the father doesnt shy away from showing the boiledup frustration and even desperation that the family usually goes through when dealing with someone with this terrible health condition i have no words to describe how thoughtful and impactful zellers storytelling method ends up being i found myself remarkably surprised once i realized the film had reached the onehour mark the control of the movies pacing and tone is absolutely seamless technically yorgos lamprinos editing work is as impeccable as ben smithards lingering cinematography however its ludovico einaudis outstanding score that steals the spotlight in the technical realm from the atmospheric grand opera music to the more subtle tracks einaudi makes sure to elevate the critical moments with a noticeable sound that helps the viewer understand the progressive shift in anthonys perception of reality zeller demonstrates immense talent in his feature film directorial debut being an adaptation from his own play certainly aids him in bringing the story from stagetoscreen but his filmmaking choices are worthy of recognition such as the extensive use of long takes to let the actors shine in their layered roles and since i mentioned the cast anthony hopkins delivers an awardworthy performance that only finds in chadwick boseman ma raineys black bottom a serious rival for this years awards season hopkins holds countless astonishing displays throughout his career but this one is definitely one of my favorites i never anticipated id shed so many tears by watching an old man cry or getting slapped in the face though its not even due to the acts themselves but to everything that builds up those moments during most of the runtime i dont really feel sadness or anger instead i feel every characters pain because its incredibly hard to watch how everyone deals with the situation hopkins and olivia colman are undoubtedly the most impactful but olivia williams and imogen poots also add a lot to the sentimental component i insinuate above that the father impacted me at a personal level a little bit about my life my grandfather didnt have dementia but his mind slowly deteriorated until it reached a point where he had to spend his last few months on this planet stuck in a bed without really talking or moving still to this day part of me regrets not spending that much time with him near the end while the other part feels a bit relieved that my memory of him in his normal state remains intact i always feared that if i visited him often in his last days of living id only remember his time at the nursing home instead of the years packed with tremendously essential lessons he taught me this movie left me sleepless spending the night thinking about that time of my life the father is an overwhelmingly devastating depiction of the painfully progressive disease that is dementia florian zellers extremely captivating storytelling places the viewers inside the protagonists mind making the audience witness and feel everything through his unclear perspective zeller and christopher hampton deliver a brilliantly unique screenplay packed with emotional punches that will leave no one indifferent from the perfect editing to the persistent camera work its ludovico einaudis gorgeous impactful score that elevates the big moments zellers use of long takes feels both necessary and important to attach the viewers attention to anthony hopkins who delivers an awardworthy powerfully compelling performance one of my favorites of his entire career hopefully this will be the closest ill ever be to experience this mental condition my personal connection to this film justifies why ill offer it my highest rating since november 2019 ford v ferrari  one of the best movies ive seen in the last couple of years do not miss it  ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog if youve been following me closely for the past week im currently re watching five of david finchers films in preparation for his next movie mank which premieres on netflix in a couple of weeks ive already revisited se7en and fight club two iconic films that not only profoundly impacted filmmaking but also our culture however zodiac isnt one of finchers most popular movies and maybe thats one of the reasons why im watching it for the very first time based on a real story finchers first nonfiction adaptation is also one of the longest films of his career i didnt know anything about the true events before watching this movie which leads me to the biggest compliment i can offer to this type of film there are hundreds of characteristics that a viewer can observe analyze and through them ultimately form an overall opinion about a movie nevertheless when it comes to cinematic adaptations of a true story theres always one aspect that i value tremendously which is how much the film convinces me to research about its story after i finish watching it truth is midway through zodiac i started to acknowledge its lengthy duration dont be mistaken its not what people call a slow movie much on the contrary its long yes but its packed with nonstop rapidfire dialogues that fincher himself asked the actors to speed up so that the runtime wouldnt stretch even more throughout the entire film i feel the exact same manner as the main characters for the first hour or so the case is ramping up the murders increase in quantity new developments emerge just like new suspects letters ciphers and everything that comes with dealing with this serial killer during this period i feel extremely captivated but then comes a phase where the characters themselves start to give up due to the lack of concrete evidence to finally convict a suspect i feel the frustration depression and even the infuriating absence of a clear path to the killer however robert graysmiths jake gyllenhaal obsession with the case starts becoming my own and the last thirty minutes are incredibly stressful frightful and enthusiastic zodiac possesses 157 minutes mostly consisting of talking and only a couple of stylish slowmotion murder scenes so obviously this is a dialoguedriven narrative james vanderbilts screenplay is packed with detailed characterization extensive conversations and from what i could gather an impressive historical accuracy fincher and vanderbilt prove their unbelievable commitment with the mindblowing preparation for this flick which basically included an entirely unique investigation on the real case interviewing the people who give life to the movies protagonists family members police departments witnesses etc  yet another evidence that supports the importance of the preproduction phase in filmmaking so in case i forget to answer my own question zodiac achieved its primary mission as soon as the film ended i found myself googling everything about the real case trying to find out new information obsessed with the intriguing story it doesnt even matter if the viewer loves the movie or not its impact is undeniable since most people will feel the same urgency to understand more about the real case two other attributes deeply contribute to this result the cast and the editing the latter is performed by angus wall and his work is some of the best film editing ive ever witnessed its the main reason why the huge runtime feels adequate and why the narrative moves so well no wonder almost every job of his got so many award nominations finally the actors are all extraordinary mark ruffalo dave toschi  anthony edwards bill armstrong  robert downey jr paul avery  and jake gyllenhaal portray distinct welldeveloped characters who deal with the case in their own way obsession is definitely the fundamental social theme present in the movie depicted differently with each character armstrong completely moves on and never looks back toschi tries to forget but he cant accept that he failed to do his job avery develops a mental condition and or addiction due to its inability to deal with the pressure stress and frustration of reporting the case graysmith lets his total obsession over zodiac impact his personal life affecting his family in the process fincher is able to represent each and every one of these behaviors in an astonishingly realistic fashion the use of long uninterrupted takes helps the conversations flow better and the simple nondistracting camera work from harry savides lets the viewer focus on who theyre listening to its one of those films which i cant really point out direct flaws theres that period during the second act where i start to feel tired and worn out and despite the irreprehensible dedication to providing every single bit of knowledge about the actual events its still an enormous amount of information to process which made me feel a bit lost occasionally fortunately the movie ends strongly culminating in a simple yet powerful exchange of looks all in all zodiac gains the most generous praise that a film based on a true story can ever receive from me james vanderbilts screenplay convinced me to research everything about the real events as soon as the movie finished which is undeniably an impactful effect of watching such a wellwritten captivating narrative with welldeveloped authentic characters david finchers commitment to being as historically accurate as possible is visible onscreen a remarkable result of a massive preparation that very few filmmakers would even think about performing with some of the best editing work in the history of cinema the lengthy runtime flows better than expected but the amount of information to digest is overwhelming and tiresome dropping the levels of entertainment especially during a certain period of the second act nevertheless a phenomenal third act three outstanding performances from mark ruffalo robert downey jr and jake gyllenhaal and an emotionally compelling realistic approach to extreme obsession turn the entire film into one of the best of its genre another massive recommendation from this side ",

most anticipated films of the festival including my own the buzz surrounding its oscar chances the remarkable cast and mainly its important narrative based on true events were more than enough reasons to generate an undeniably powerful hype when i watch movies inspired by real people and or true stories i want them to teach me about the historical moment theyre depicting i want to finish my viewing sessions and know more than what i did at its beginning i want the film to be enlightening thoughtprovoking and most of all impactful im just a young white man living in portugal with no previous knowledge of who fred hampton was or what he did the closest i got to learning something about him was during last years the trial of the chicago 7 but that movie wasnt even focused on the black panther party let alone one of his most important revolutionaries my voice is far from being meaningful in regards to this film and i will share black critics articles that i find to be worthy of investing your time in reading however i do have an opinion about this movie and im in my right to share it i find shaka kings flick to have all of the qualities i mentioned above and much more one of the best films of the festival and im not risking it by writing it will end up as one of my favorite movies of the year in all honesty i found myself struggling to completely understand fred hamptons intent during the first half or so his goals are clear and can be summed up in simply trying to offer everyone a better life one that was fair and where everyone was treated equally my issue wasnt in his motivations or beliefs but on the violent murderous path that hampton was apparently inciting people to take  i repeat i didnt know a single thing about the real story nor hampton himself however daniel kaluuyas very first words as the character stuck with me until now  were not gonna fight fire with fire were gonna fight it with water were not gonna fight racism with racism were gonna fight it with solidarity were not gonna fight capitalism with black capitalism were gonna fight it with socialism  and he kept developing this idea which i find incredibly timely the scene that ultimately cleared my perception of hamptons ideas was when william oneal takes the latters most famous speech at the end of the second act in its most literal sense which leaves hampton baffled and shocked at oneals interpretation of his words hamptons reaction as well as a more emotional moment with the mother of his child deborah johnson dominique fishback  was the click i needed to fully comprehend the revolutionarys desires this is one of the best compliments i can offer shaka king and will bersons exquisite detailed screenplay it doesnt make hampton a flawless superhero that never makes mistakes but instead depicts him as a human being who fought for everyones rights the latter is closer to being a messiah than the former the intricate narrative might feel a bit too heavy for some viewers but it packs extraordinarily energetic inspirational chillinducing speeches that i wont forget that soon both hampton and oneal raise sensitive themes that will definitely leave the audience thinking and discussing them throughout the year despite it being the longest film of the festival its twohour runtime feels adequate and wellpaced in addition to this the terrific in your face cinematography sean bobbitt focuses on the actors performances not giving a chance to the viewers to be distracted with anything else besides the characters words the emotional investment in the characters elevates the welledited kristan sprague shooting sequences that left me on the edge of my seat couch  which ultimately serves as a huge praise to the movies writing i left the cast for last now i know 2021 just started but if daniel kaluuya isnt nominated in every single awards show for the respective best supporting actor category ill riot ive yet to witness a lessthangreat display from this unbelievably talented actor kaluuya is exceptionally captivating from the very first time he shows up onscreen and never drops his level lakeith stanfield is also brilliant as a conflicted william oneal delivering an extremely complex portrayal of someone who has to deal with actions he knows are wrong dominique fishback and jesse plemons roy mitchell an fbi agent also deserve a shoutout judas and the black messiah deserves all the hype its been getting and some more shaka king and will berson deliver a film inspired by true events with all the qualities this type of movie needs enlightening inspirational thoughtprovoking and tremendously impactful boasting what im sure will end up as one of the years best performances daniel kaluuya  the story of fred hampton and william oneal is told through an incredibly captivating narrative filled to the brim with absolutely epic riveting chillinducing speeches and dialogues that will leave no viewer indifferent both characters bring timely themes back to the spotlight hopefully generating a critical discourse regarding freedom human rights and equality besides kaluuya lakeith stanfield deserves massive praise and i cant forget about the lingering characterdriven cinematography that elevates every single scene final shoutout to mark isham and craig harriss unforgettable addictive score that plays a significant role in the narrative

expensive there is only one film theater in my city every time i want to watch a movie on imax or dolby atmos its a financial effort and timeconsuming and the worst of all a whole bunch of films arent released in their original date especially november december oscarbait movies only now i had the opportunity to see green book and i am so mad i wasnt able to write its review in 2018 because this is undoubtedly the best comedydrama of last year and one of the best overall with the help of a terrific cast peter farrelly and his writing crew which counts with vallelongas son nick deliver what i think is the best screenplay of 2018 i cant remember the last time i cried of so much laughter in a film i cant remember the last time i did the latter and still got emotional with the dramatic arc this comedydrama sent me through a roller coaster of emotions i wasnt expecting at all i went in anticipating outstanding performances check and solely that since 2019 has already begun im watching the oscarbait movies with no real hopes of being utterly amazed however green book completely took me by surprise i genuinely dont know why everyone was so shocked when it won best screenplay at the golden globe awards it possesses such a wellwritten story filled with brilliant narratives about the most sensitive subjects it takes the two main characters and elevates their individual arcs into subplots where you begin and end with two completely different personas its an extremely relevant film that shows how our world evolved and fought back racism and discrimination without ever becoming too dark or even dull its not more of the same its not another movie produced exclusively to send a social message and catch some oscar nominations its a truly captivating story of how two men can change their perspective of another race or even the entire world by actually spending time with another culture and ignoring preconceived notions nevertheless this wellstructured beautifullydirected and cleverlywritten film would be just good if not for the two incredible actors who take this movie to a whole other level viggo mortensen and mahershala ali have such compelling chemistry that i wouldnt mind watching them interact for two hours on a car trip every single car sequence either produces hilarious moments filled with tearful laughter or it drastically changes into a more dramatic and emotional tone subtly touching delicate topics i knew mortensen had a humorous side to him but i never saw this coming his timing his expressions his italian accent his body movements everything about his performance is perfect he absolutely nailed his part by giving me the best time i had at a film theater in a long time and his oscar nomination is more than fair he made a 130min feature movie feel like a short flick ali doesnt come far behind obviously since viggo has a funnier role to portray the audience members might feel that hes just there to help his costar shine but he does much more than that since he brings the drama element to the story he has a more restrained performance during the first half of the film however once shirley starts getting along with tony lip ali gradually offers more and more splendid acting moments hes definitely a supporting actor but god is he a phenomenal one linda cardellini dolores vallelonga  even though shes only onscreen for a few minutes spread throughout the runtime also delivers a great performance tony lip and dr don shirley have quite distinct personalities besides being from different races each characters arc is brilliantly illustrated by peter farrelly who gradually shows how tony and don are changing their view of the world and of each others culture either through the witty car sequences or through unfortunate and horrible experiences these two characters carry the audience on a journey of growth change in behavior mindset and preconceived ideas by sharing their own culture with another even though they were born in different countries and lived through distinguished lifestyles with contrasting quality of life they eventually start realizing that what they think of the world and everything else might not be entirely right technically farrelly controls the movies pacing exceptionally well by making a twohourish film feel like half of it remarkablybalanced tone and some great cinematography is showed in a couple of scenes consistentlyfilmed and welledited even though the latter has small hiccups here and there nevertheless this isnt a film with extraordinary technical attributes nor it needs them farrelly only needed to do ok with the producing and filming of a standout screenplay to achieve a fantastic result and thats exactly what he did finally regarding the controversy surrounding this movie  see how easy it is to watch a film without being affected by outside matters which dont have a single thing to do with the movie itself i dont care if someone who worked in the film tweeted something wrong today let alone years ago i dont care if someone misinterprets viggo mortensens speech about racism i dont care if the family of don shirley doesnt like how the movie approaches his way of being or his way of life i dont care if the story isnt 100 true as long as it succeeds in transmitting the vital message it wants to deliver while actually being a good film so please stop trying to listen to everything everyone says about a movie or the people working on it especially nowadays where chaos is easy to create green book surprised the hell out of me and left me speechless in the end one of the best comedydramas ive seen in a long time one of the best films of 2017 and by far the best original screenplay of the last year peter farrelly and his fellow cowriters delivered a seamlesslywritten story filled with wonderful character arcs and with a quite important message to the audiences around the world viggo mortensen and mahershala ali deliver awardworthy performances especially the former who shows his incredible comedic timing and dramatic range still the most compelling and emotional scenes come from ali and he does not deserve to be forgotten i thought 2018 was going to be the first year without me giving an a  but guess what   ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog  first of all you can read my review of one of my favorite movies of 2017 jordan peeles get out by clicking its title one of the best featurelong debuts of alltime by a writerdirector who i wish he discovered his filmmaker skills sooner because the horror genre urgently needed someone like him peele is starting to become one of hollywoods most notable people and he proves once again now with us that his undeniable talent is going to leave our jaws dropped and our minds confused for quite some years while i do think that his first film is more consistent and better structured us is so far the best movie of the year and i doubt that it will stop being part of that list by the end of it the best films are the ones that can transform a 45min car ride back home from the theater into a blink of an eye i spent all that time plus some more minutes discussing and arguing with my partner who i saw the movie with by now i have a pretty decent understanding of the films story and of lupitas character arc which will definitely leave you extremely confused and mindblown by the end of the movie however i will see it a second time to make sure my theory aligns with everything else especially those tiny little details we dont really think they matter when they actually do peeles screenplay is thoughtprovoking and suspenseful filled with brilliant character development and surprisingly wellfilmed action scenes i guess he knows how to do anything efficiently the chasing scenes are riveting and the fights are bloody awesome in addition to this most of the action occurs at night which requires the director to know what hes doing so the audience is able to follow whats happening i never not once lost my place during an action sequence i knew who everyone was where were they at and what were they doing nowadays having in mind how actual action blockbusters are being made this is the best praise i can give a director regarding these type of scenes a lot of articles are calling jordan peele the next spielberg or new hitchcock im calling him the first jordan peele i would have loved to be the one who came up with this last sentence but i wasnt and im so happy about it it means that more people are starting to plant into their minds that peele is one of a kind not one like the other his trademark closeup shots right in the actors faces can show and tell so much about a character besides that the actors will have a golden opportunity to show their enormous emotional range their incredible expressions their limitless talent that is if you are someone like lupita nyongo right after i watched alita battle angel i called that it would get an oscar nomination for best visuals effects and i still stand by it well i also want to be the first to call not only an oscar nom but a best actress win for lupita daniel kaluuya was outstanding in get out but lupita surpasses his fellow comrade with two  powerfully captivating performances as the original mother she shows kindness and endearing traits as her doppelganger shes scary menacing and evil two completely different characters with distinct physical and psychological characteristics are no problem for lupita she handles them in such a flawless and effortless manner carrying the entire narrative on her shoulders like it was nothing she deserves every recognition there is nonetheless she still received great help from the remaining cast winston duke gabe wilson is hilarious and hes the primary source of comedy throughout the film with a remarkable balance of tones peele lets duke shine in a role that he thrives on us can be very heavy and dark at times so a good laugh here and there is always welcome the young actors are also great but i have to congratulate shahadi wright josephs performance as zora wilson she has approximately the same age amandla stenberg had in the hunger games at the time i knew stenberg would be an outstanding actress and i was not wrong now im 100 certain that shahadi will be an exceptional one if she isnt already technically i already wrote above how talented peele is from his seamless ability to film action sequences in the dark to his brilliantlywritten screenplay he nails almost every aspect of his movie the score beautifully accompanies the narrative with cool rhythmic songs when everything seems fine and with loud angelically weird voices that instantly change the tone flawless editing helps hide some nitpicks i have with some exposition scenes especially towards the end while i understand that the story has a lot to take in once explained i believe peele does so in a slightly too fast monologue that i think some people wont quite enjoy for me i would have loved total ambiguity if they didnt explain a thing i would have been ecstatic but i understand the need to do it my other gripe with the film is the other family portrayed mainly by the always astonishing elizabeth moss kitty tyler  and tim heidecker josh tyler  thinking about them and their importance to the story i find that either they could have been better utilized or they shouldnt even exist its the middle ground between these two options that bothers me a little since it feels like these two remarkable actors especially moss were left aside too much they are indeed relevant to elevate the story as a whole but i still wish they were explored a bit better sadly i think audiences will like get out more even though us has more of the horror genres traits than the first not only due to the story being more comfortable to follow and ultimately understand some people actually left my theater way before the end shame on you  but also because it has a definite ending unfortunately people dont really like to think about a movie after it finished so if it has some sort of openending theyre going to be mad thats what happens if you go into us expecting a cheap horror film filled with cliche jump scares and hollow characters this is not a scary flick it is a horror movie and a phenomenal one in case you want a simple spoilerfree advice on how to approach the films story ill leave just one small sentence after my rating jordan peele is one of a kind he is not like anyone else once again he offers a thoughtprovoking deeply layered and incredibly suspenseful narrative captivating and entertaining from beginning to end with no misstep along the way technically seamless with his emotionallydriven trademark closeups on the characters faces being a standout lupita nyongo delivers what i believe its her careerbest performance s  which should grab her not only a bunch of award nominations but wins as well brilliant cast tonally wellbalanced with hilarious comedy and filled with excitingly scary action sequences us does not have a single interpretation my perspective is not right or wrong its just my point of view its one of those movies you can watch time and time again and each viewing will give you another insight that you missed before however i do think that what happens at the very end its true and i have more than enough hints throughout the film to sustain my opinion despite some minor issues nitpicks its undoubtedly the best movie of 2019 so far and i highly doubt it will be out of my top10 by the end of the year thank you peele not only for giving us great horror films but for being yourself go see it  advice focus on the boys actions and how he reacts to everything he sees or does",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog sonic the hedgehog was one of my most anticipated movies of 2020 not because i expected it to be one of the best films of the year but due to the controversy that surrounded it the original design of sonic was awful and a lot of people still blame the vfx artists animators unfairly these people work extra hours theyre underpaid and they were given an impossible schedule to deliver a masterful work fortunately most people now recognize that the studio and all of its execs are the ones to blame the internet voiced its opinion in a very polite manner as usual  but this time an unprecedented event occurred the studio actually listened and decided to delay the movie until sonic received a better treatment visually now i firmly believe that in any other case this would be extremely dangerous i dont think the audience should have this much power over the studios especially through social media i mean if studios changed their films every time people criticized a design or an adaptation decision movies would be constantly delayed however in this particular case im super glad they did it one question a lot of people might ask is how would this film perform with the old design it would be horrible theres absolutely no chance of people enjoying this movie with the previous sonic this new design not only honors the characters visuals but it complements the films tone jim carrey delivers an incredibly cartoonish performance which would become way too outofplace if sonic looked awfully real having both the hero and villain being acting like a cartoon that awkwardness doesnt exist sonic truly is the best part of the whole thing if youve played the games and if you carry an emotional connection to this character there are tons of scenes for you to enjoy sonic looks wonderful sounds fantastic excellent voice work from ben schwartz  and best of all his personality resembles the videogame character everything thats directly sonicrelated is perfectly faithful to the source material which will definitely please every sonic fan thats pretty much my main message if youre a fan of the little blue guy i cant imagine anyone being disappointed unfortunately hes honestly the only great aspect of the movie its really cool to watch jim carrey going back to his roots and having so much fun with his role however hes very hitandmiss when hes condescending someone hes quite funny but carreys mannerisms dont always work still once again i believe hes very faithful to the original dr robotnik who was by no means a normal person james marsden is really good as tom but his character never goes beyond sonics pal my main issues are regarding the screenplay no i never expected it to be an oscarworthy narrative i just wanted a simple story that allowed sonic to shine and in the films defense its indeed a basic plot however the sheer abundance of cliches the lack of any surprises and the logical questions raised by some narrative decisions are too much to handle in my opinion there are three product placement scenes that are some of the laziest obvious cringeworthy examples since the transformers movies it feels like the film stops to have a few commercials subplots that serve as tensionbuilding during the movie fail to have a resolution by the end storylines that were once important are entirely forgotten and never addressed again every single character serves as comicrelief everyone gets to be the clown i repeat i never expected a brilliant screenplay but is it too much to ask the writers to have as much dedication and creativity as the vfx artists who handled sonic the latter group worked like crazy to deliver a perfect design why cant the writers try harder to offer a more compelling unique and rational story the way dr robotnik comes into play and the level of permission he has to do whatever he desires to is laughable everything humanrelated raises too many eyebrows and rolls too many eyes ive commented about the film online and some people addressed me by saying youre overanalyzing youre expecting too much from it i wholeheartedly understand these observations i genuinely do the thing is i dont believe im overthinking let alone expecting it to be a masterpiece why should people simply accept that a movie cant be better than what it is why cant people ask for the potential that a sonic film has why should i be content that its not bad im completely honest i wanted to like this movie way more than most people the whole controversy concerning sonics design and the unfair blame that the vfx artists received left me with an overwhelming desire to absolutely love this film so i could support the massive work that these people went through i love everything thats sonicrelated in the movie his design voice and personality are spoton and i cant imagine a single fan of the little blue hedgehog being disappointed however even with a really good cast and a 90s jim carrey sonic the hedgehog is packed with extreme cliches and narrative decisions that roll too many eyes some of the most obvious and cringeworthy product placement since michael bays transformers characters built from hollywoods recycling box and side stories are thrown away with no resolution its a fun adventure that any family can enjoy on a sunday afternoon but i cant lie to myself i wish it could have been more entertaining and less frustrating storywise  ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog  quentin tarantino is one of the best filmmakers of alltime he has undeniable talent behind the camera and his movies are fated to leave a mark in each year theyre released in addition to that hes also an extraordinary screenwriter as once upon a time in hollywood proves once again his knowledge of the early decades of film is vast so every feature he produces is always going to be filled with references to those fairy tale years and thats precisely what this movie is a fairy tale in hollywood hence its title let me just leave this here right off the bat im not going to address any controversy surrounding this film namely the whole bruce lee depiction and the manson family in general  as im always fair and impartial to the movie im reviewing moving on my knowledge of the 60s isnt that good obviously i know the whole sharon tate story as well as the famous manson murders but when it comes to actual films from that decade well probably i only know a few by name a classic scene or a memorable soundtrack tarantino uses his large runtime to place tons of references to that period and thats one of the reasons the first act of the movie drags theres a lot of time spent with characters just driving cars while listening to music references in the songs  wide shots of the city as they drive by references in the buildings  or even just playing an lp and dancing to it reference in the songs again  i understand that these mean something but if they dont develop the character in any way then these are just easter eggs and have no impact on the actual narrative the first hour or so is filled with sequences which sole purpose is to show how much tarantino knows about that time and theres nothing wrong with it as long as it tells a story thats the second issue i have with the first act it takes too long to establish its characters and theres no apparent objective within the story it feels like a person just strolling around with no destination which in itself isnt a bad thing but if you put together repetitive sequences plus a story that no one knows where its going or how it connects to the only thing people are actually expecting the sharon tate event  then youll bore the hell out of the audience a lot of people constantly left my theater to get more food or something and they werent in a hurry  nevertheless from the moment we start understanding who rick dalton and cliff booth are what they do what they did and what they want with their lives then the film becomes incredibly captivating its definitely a characterdriven story its a fairy tale where rick tries his best to overcome his own personal issues to be the very best movie star after being on an exponentially negative path cliff as his stunt double lives off of his buddy by doing everything he needs around the house and everywhere else these two are inseparable and their scenes are always filled with laughter and joy even in the darkest moments ouatih works because of its beautifullywritten characters if you dont care about them then you wont enjoy the film at all in addition to this if you dont know anything regarding the art of filmmaking then youll probably hate it since it will become extremely dull its one of those movies that anyone can like however for someone who knows and understands how films are made it will always be a better time at the theater you can love this movie sure but if you love filmmaking and you have knowledge of its techniques youll love it even more there are so many technical achievements worthy of appreciation that i cant get to all of them so ill just address two of my favorites the first has to be the blackandwhite flicks inside the actual film putting leonardo dicaprio acting on classic westerns with overthetop performances is an absolute delight watching those features in a 43 blackandwhite screen filled with classic sound effects and cheesy oneliners wonderful the second allows for my favorite scenes of the whole movie the extensive onetake dialogues i mean 10 or 15minute sequences where dicaprio just gives it his all this is how every single film should be done theres even a joke in the movie where rick criticizes a particular type of filmmaking because they would film every character separately saying their lines and then editing them together unfortunately thats how most features are done today therefore from watching a simple dialogue scene with dicaprio and julia butters a 10yearold little girl to a bar sequence which belongs to a movie rick is filming this one even has rick asking his lines and the camera has to go back to its starting point  everything with no cuts whatsoever what can i ask more from a director obviously if this is a characterdriven narrative the cast has to be genuinely compelling leonardo dicaprio brad pitt margot robbie i mean do i even need to explain how phenomenal they are dicaprio proves once again hes one of the greatest actors of alltime the ability that he has to put 200 in every single scene is unbelievable i even started to tear up once his character is able to find his footing solely due to the actors performance the oscar nom is guaranteed lets see about the win brad pitt also has tons of nominations on his lap with an astonishing supporting display he has a subtle performance but its pretty incredible how much he can transmit to the audience by putting apparently so little effort margot robbie doesnt have that much screentime but her character had the simple objective of showing how glamorous and dreamy an actress life could be at that time so she didnt exactly need to deliver her agame its always good to see al pacino marvin schwarz onscreen and im thrilled that margaret qualley pussycat  who i know from the leftovers one of the most underrated tv shows of the century  is finally getting some recognition technically like i said above its close to a masterpiece its tarantino everyone knows what hes capable of but having in mind his most recent features its a pleasant surprise and evidence of quality to the naysayers that he was able to produce a film with less bloody action there are terrific demonstrations of great cinematography robert richardson  and the editing is always impeccable in tarantinos features this time due to fred raskin  the score is addictive and it carries a very significant role in the movie i would say that if tarantino was able to shorten its runtime and control its pacing better this would be a technically perfect film all in all once upon a time in hollywood isnt the best quentin tarantinos movie but its undoubtedly one of the years best filled with awardwinning lead performances second oscar for dicaprio please  this characterdriven story is packed with references to the 60s which will be the divisive point in whether people will enjoy the film or not its first act is slow and takes too long to set up its story but from the moment its able to find its footing its an entertaining ride if you love filmmaking and you know the insides of the art tarantino delivers a nearperfect technical production its alternate ending to reallife events is meant to be controversial but for me its a vision of how everything should have happened if the world was fair or indeed a fairy tale in hollywood ",
