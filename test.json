    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog  obviously joker is one of my most anticipated movies of 2019 i mean how couldnt it be besides belonging to the superhero genre dc has been on a streak of great films within its universe so an isolated installment definitely excites me especially about one of the evilest villains ever its by far one of the less comicbooky flicks of the century it doesnt follow the generic origin story formula it avoids any cliches associated with the genre and its the type of movie thats becoming more and more rare nowadays its a character study like we havent seen in a long time ill simply begin with the person that elevates the entire thing joaquin phoenix now if theres something im not going to do is compare his performance with heath ledgers thats the number one mistake people are going to keep making forever first of all the dark knight and joker couldnt be more distinct films even if they belong to the same genre despite joker being unique its still about a famous comicbook villain  then despite phoenix and ledger portraying the same version of the clown crazy sadistic psychopath  the former is 90 arthur fleck while the latter is 100 joker throughout each of their movies finally phoenix is the sole protagonist of this feature while ledger had the best liveaction batman sharing the spotlight in conclusion its both unfair and a bit unreasonable to compare both interpretations since their roles have a different impact on the narrative as well as each film being entirely different in the end both are impressive however lets switch to phoenix since hes the star of this show he has 2019s best performance by far with a strong marketing campaign im sure hell get that oscar i hope so its so welldeserved todd phillips and scott silver developed a brilliant screenplay but phoenix elevates it to a whole other level throughout the entire runtime i felt weird perturbed even uncomfortable with what i was watching and consequently feeling its a dark brutal violent emotionally powerful origin of a villain who i feel disturbingly empathetic towards phoenix makes the story work due to its remarkably captivating display of someone whos mentally ill arthur fleck slowly becoming crazier is due to how society behaves and not due to some chemical pool that transforms his skin white and hair green nothing wrong with this but i know which origin story i prefer  the world is getting crazier out there and it becomes excruciatingly painful to deal with it especially when so much is going on with arthurs personal life and most of it he doesnt even realize because he tries to hide everything behind a smile its a screenplay filled with narrative twists that not only pack a punch of surprise but leave you feeling extremely upset the last act is one of the best in the last few years if the second act is an enormous buildup the last one is a terrific payoff i cant remember the last movie i saw where i loved 100 every single narrative decision i wouldnt do any of the big moments differently there are so many excellent references hidden in plain sight that comicbook fans and fans of the tdk trilogy as well will love just like i did in the ending theres one pivotal moment in particular that serves as the absolute climax i got chills all over my body they couldnt have done that scene more perfect i only have one tiny nitpick with the way some scenes feel repetitive since they neither move the plot forward or give us anything new some of these still help to create tension some feel like theyre just there a best picture and best actor nominations seem to be on its way but these are not the only achievements that deserve to be recognized the original score by hildur gu nad ttir is incredibly addictive so much that im listening to it while writing this review it definitely helps to generate tremendous buildup and it elevates the sinister environment of gotham city lawrence shers cinematography is utterly stunning the underexposure of some scenes is glorious sher paints the screen with so many gorgeous shots especially with his closeups on phoenix where the latter is able to shine jeff groth is also impeccable in the editing room there are several long takes with phoenix just giving his all and letting all his emotions out or keeping them all contained  which is always something i deeply appreciate since it helps with the flow of the narrative regarding the films controversy surrounding its messages and the incentive to violence i really dont know what to say its ridiculous i remember those times when going into the movie theater was a surreal experience it was the number one place for people to forget about their lives jobs everything joker is a fictional story its the origin of one of the worst psychopaths in the history of comicbooks and cinema if people expected to leave the theater happy or joyful then at least one of the films message is right society really is getting crazier have people forgotten who joker is what could you possibly expect from his origin story nowadays no one knows how to behave social media is the primary source for spreading hate  no one respects the fellow citizen or even the world itself more and more people only look at their own bellies political agendas are everywhere new extreme movements are created every other year social hypersensibility is exponentially growing the same way some people will hate this movie for not being able or simply not wanting to accept that they feel empathy towards a murderer people all around the world behave like their actions dont reflect on another persons life and on their own planet if people get ruthlessly violent because they watched joker how can someone complain that the films message is bad when its eventually true all in all joker is one of the best movies of the year and its definitely on my top3 at the date of this review joaquin phoenix delivers my favorite male performance of 2019 by elevating a script about the origin of one of the evilest villains ever the way he gradually becomes more insane is worthy of study but its how hes able to make the audience create empathy towards a psychopath that leaves me disturbingly captivated todd phillips produces a characterstudy filled with an astonishingly tense buildup and one of the most chillinducing payoffs of the last few years with every single narrative decision nailed perfectly hildur gu nad ttirs score and lawrence shers cinematography stand out the lack of restraint in showing the unmerciful violence physical and mental that society inflicts on one another is what makes us feel unsettled because we know its mostly true and we refuse to accept it its not a film about the joker its a very realistic portrayal of someone anyone who can become someone like him and its disturbingly brilliant ps robert deniro murray franklin and zazie beetz sophie dumond are also great phoenixs performance is so mesmerizing that i almost forgot there were other actors in the movie ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog even though the white tiger isnt exactly the first review i published in 2021 it was the first film i watched at the start of this new year i really didnt know what to expect ive never seen anything from any actor involved in the movie or from the writerdirector ramin bahrani i still follow the trailerfree philosophy that i established back in 2017 so my knowledge about the actual story was close to null nevertheless all of these details left me quite excited to be completely honest starting 2021 with a 100 blind watch something i sincerely appreciate is an excellent way of beginning a year that i hope will be better than the previous one it shouldnt be that hard  from the getgo its clear that bahrani will use his film in an enlightening educational manner to teach its viewers about indias sociopolitical stratification caste system and its economic consequences the viewer follows adarsh gouravs character balram whos trying to get away from the dated traditions and become a real entrepreneur i rarely love straightup political movies even when these follow the satire route on par with religion these are two matters that ive been avoiding talking about my whole life from corruption to wars there are literally hundreds of reasons that justify my detachment from these topics with that said the white tiger holds several significant messages concerning poor families low caste who must work hard in unimaginable conditions just to survive specifically in india it also approaches ideas such as arranged marriage and the unbreakable masterservant bond these cultural lessons on indias sociopolitical and socioeconomic structure are by far the most interesting aspect of the entire screenplay and bahrani does a fantastic job of conveying this awareness to the audience in a compelling manner with the help of paolo carnera dp  the story is filmed at groundlevel putting the viewers in the dirty smelly impoverished streets of different places across india generating a realistic atmosphere chad keiths production design is also vital to create that immersive indian environment despite the wonderful technical aspects bahranis script is packed with an overwhelming succession of narrative events that fail to further develop the protagonist or impact the story especially from the midpoint of the film onwards some sequences are similar to previous ones ultimately making the movie feel repetitive while not moving the plot forward unfortunately it really feels like the viewers could miss a couple of minutes here and there and not miss anything genuinely relevant therefore bahranis flick becomes overlong and slower than what it needs to be consequently affecting the viewers attention which might result in some of the critical messages getting lost in the transmission mainly the economic one balrams narration helps but bahrani could have found a better and more logical justification for this storytelling detail in addition to this its a film that depends on the viewers knowledge about india and their interest in learning more about it in my case the white tiger didnt surprise me with any information  which doesnt help the entertainment value  but its visuals helped me connect what i knew to something quite palpable i do want to end on a positive note though the unknown cast is phenomenal but the biggest praise must go to adarsh gouravs first lead role balram is a wellwritten character who will definitely connect with many viewers all around the world gourav shows quite a good range demonstrating his comedic timing and funny expressions but also an emotional side that truly elevated some of the best scenes in the entire movie the white tiger employs the english and indian languages to educate viewers about indias sociopolitical and socioeconomic system by following adarsh gouravs character who narrates the largest email ever about his life despite the somewhat silly setup ramin bahrani delivers an enlightening interesting narrative with dozens of relevant messages regarding indias culture and the incredibly challenging way of living of most of its population gourav offers a brilliant performance debut in a lead role  elevating a wellwritten relatable character who goes through an unbelievable life story surrounded by an immersive production design and terrific camera work creating a realistic environment unfortunately this netflixs flick is overwhelmed by an absurd amount of gradually unimpactful narrative events unnecessarily extending the runtime and hurting the overall pacing by becoming repetitive the viewers attention levels decrease leading to a scenario where some of the essential lessons get lost in their delivery overall i recommend it to viewers interested in learning more about india and people who actually lived or were born there but if your knowledge about the country is good enough it might not be as entertaining and informative as you would expect  ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog after years of outstanding effort from passionate fans warner bros finally decided to give zack snyder the opportunity to finish his movie on his own terms 2017s justice league went through massive production issues  explained in my review of said film  and despite years of extremely tiresome toxic discourse on social media the famous snyder cut got a controversyinducing budget to complete an undoubtedly unfinished cut a crucial disclaimer youll see countless reviews based on wholly different approaches some people will review it as a standalone regular movie while others will look at it as an extended alternate cut of a film previously released im part of the latter group of reviewers i find it a bit unfair to criticize pacing issues or an overlong runtime when the purpose of this cut is precisely to show everything snyder had in his hand director extended ultimate cut call it what you feel its appropriate but its a fourhour movie so many scenes will inevitably drag or feel unnecessary and irrelevant the narrative is fundamentally the same which means the audience knows whats coming from a general perspective still im reviewing this version mostly on its own merits but without forgetting that its not a regular theatrical film and that it unquestionably builds upon what was already released without getting into spoilers i do have to write this the heavy marketing was incredibly misleading and i dont doubt for a second that many fans will feel disappointed regarding certain story points and particular characters the whole its a totally distinct movie or joss whedon only used 10 of snyders footage were nothing more than false publicity for a cut that honestly didnt need it out of the 119 minutes of the 2017s version probably around 80 90 minutes are also in the snyder cut which will be surprising for people who expected something entirely unique the base of the narrative is identical most scenes are just extended versions of the original but there are a couple of significant new changes that ultimately make zack snyders justice league better than its predecessor the most impactful modification that drastically changes the emotional core of the film is about cyborg ray fishers character goes from barely having any remotely significant screentime in 2017 to being the heart and soul of the movie from his backstory to the development across the runtime cyborg is undoubtedly the superhero that gains the most with this cut leaving as a complete compelling character who i genuinely cared for on the other hand aquaman and the flash receive similar introductory scenes with batman barely getting any sort of new individual growth besides more action sequences however once the league is assembled the character interactions increase improving their team spirit and deeply elevating the us united storyline the humor and tone remain lighter than in other snyder films clearly something that the filmmaker always had in mind for his version whedon only added a couple of more jokes since most of them are present in this cut  the intimidating runtime does negatively affect the overall pacing but the longer buildups and extensive dialogue scenes make the full movie much more cohesive and coherent compared to the originals abrupt awful editing work the snyder cut has a tremendously better flow giving time for information to sink in and characters to get used to each other i rather watch an overlong film with a wellbuilt story than the complete contrary some color changes and tone adjustments also improve the movies consistency storywise besides the fantastic arc given to cyborg there are a couple of changes that heavily affect either a particular character or a secondary storyline but when it comes to the main narrative its more or less about the same every action sequence with preexistent footage is visually improved and extended with scenes not seen before but the new vfx are as hitandmiss as junkie xls score the latter mixes up so many different types of tracks and music that it genuinely becomes a tad confusing while some scenes get an absolutely perfect epic soundtrack others receive weird outofplace music distracting the scene itself theres only one change i definitely dislike the r rating brings horribly artificial forced blood splashes and outofnowhere cursing that simply dont belong in the film i know snyder loves his gritty bloody gory action  as do i  but either the whole movie is consistent with this type of action or some scenes will feel like they come from a wholly separate film a few bloody sequences work well enough but most just feel notably forced while the cursing feels ridiculously outofcharacter at points its by far the most incompatible aspect of the cut but admittedly one that doesnt heavily impact my opinion a common issue i have with extended cuts is that these mostly add and rarely remove snyder cut partially breaks that rule removing some scenes from the 2017s version supposedly only whedons footage which some people wrongly believe to be almost the entire movie  while most of the decisions regarding this process are efficient theres a couple of them that not only dont improve the respective storylines but actually make them less powerful than the theatrical film for example in snyder cut the bringing superman back arc lacks an important characters take on the situation having in mind that characters past it actually feels a bit outofcharacter that the viewers dont get to see what that person thinks about a potentially devastating action regarding steppenwolf his design looks better than the terrible original and his motivations are clearer but unfortunately he remains a generic cgi punching bag for our superheroes his dynamic armor is packed with spikes but its really one of those designs with visual impact only since it has no effect whatsoever in battle i cant get into spoilers about darkseid or desaad but i can safely write that these characters are nothing more than fanservice just like joker jared leto  the ending is definitely the sequence that changes the most due to the addition of dozens of new extended action scenes and it does play out differently  though the conclusion is essentially the same  leaving the viewers with a menacing threat on the horizon zack snyders justice league is arguably a more cohesive consistent and emotionally compelling movie than the 2017s version as expected its fourhour runtime causes pacing issues and possesses dozens of unnecessary irrelevant scenes but criticizing these aspects in an admittedly nontheatrical cut is unfairly defeating its purpose despite most of the original justice league being present in the snyder cut  something that might surprise a few fans  the main narrative is built and developed through a structure that flows tremendously better than the previous edition cyborg becoming the emotional core of the story and the increased character interactions are some of the best changes zack snyder and chris terrio did the extended action sequences are more riveting and preexistent footage is definitely improved but the new vfx are as erratic as junkie xls allovertheplace score the rrating is the only straightup negative aspect that damages the film with highly forced fakelooking blood and rare yet cringeworthy cursing highly anticipated characters and or storylines are better described as unimpactful fanservice but overall most of the decisions made vastly improve upon what was already built in the end i sincerely expect a significant majority of the fandom to get their expectations fulfilled and i hope that the dceu continues with snyder involved  just as long as the studios leave filmmakers to do their job without nonsensical restrictions ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog when it comes to rosamund pike it doesnt really matter the type of film shes doing im always in her constantly dedicated incredible performances strongly grasp me to the screen every single time so i expected i care a lot to follow the same path from the most recent radioactive to one of her most famous roles in gone girl passing through numerous other memorable displays pike just cant deliver a bad interpretation being this my first viewing of a j blakesons movie and with netflix offering their pristine production value i must state that im surprised with how much i thoroughly enjoyed this film let me begin with what i think really makes this movie so attractive its screenplay pike and co all deliver outstanding performances and ill get to those but blakesons script is both crazy and smart if the premise isnt clear enough capitalism is a significant theme throughout the entire runtime from the richpoor depressing yet realistic comparisons to the ruthless competition between the socalled sharks of this economic system i care a lot provides excellent parallelism to the real world the notthatimplicit messages regarding this topic are mostly delivered by marla grayson a protagonist who doesnt shy away from assuming her lioness status possessing cunning knowledge of both the pros and cons of capitalism and its borderline legal cheats the viewer accompanies marla through her exceptionally captivating process of acquiring and profiting from a new target just like hundreds of companies and ceos around the world do without most people realizing it when marla finds a worthy competitor blakeson risks its grounded story replacing it with an absolutely lunatic second half characterized by absurd outofthisworld character and plot decisions which would be a major issue if its purpose wasnt precisely to show the ridiculous  and criminal  ambition of toptier capitalists i cant deny it gets a tad too mad and irrational for my taste but having in mind the context and blakesons goal i consider it a mostly successful play plus the entertainment value doesnt drop much on the contrary it skyrockets to a point where i welcome some of its craziness the third act boasts tremendous tension and suspense slightly unexpected developments and a shocking yet utterly perfect ending that will make most viewers say karma is a b tch right its a quite enlightening story about the reallife guardians who exploit their wards blakeson brilliantly educates the audience on the power of bureaucracy the moral compromises overly ambitious people must make and how to profit for some means lack of freedom for others marc canhams score is the technical standout delivering an electronic soundtrack that i usually dont appreciate that much but it played the right type of tracks at the perfect moments from the score alone the viewer is able to understand the importance of certain scenes and thats a massive achievement doug emmetts cinematography also allows for a few gorgeous shots with exquisite lighting but i need to move on to the fantastic performances from the cast i already approached pikes performance and at the time of this review shes already received a golden globe nomination so i dont need to further compliment her display however i cant let the rest of the cast go away without mentions peter dinklage three billboards outside ebbing missouri avengers infinity war offers one of my favorite performances from his film career with his slightly overthetop yet intriguing interpretation of a dangerous gangster eiza gonz lez bloodshot hobbs shaw alita battle angel is also pretty good as fran marlas lover and her chemistry with pike is onpoint their sparse yet impactful emotional moments are quite compelling dianne wiest is a total badass as jennifer peterson a notthatinnocent old lady and finally a shoutout to chris messina birds of prey  who hands his charm as an attentiongrabbing lawyer i care a lot is one of the best netflix movies this year has offered so far boasting an intriguing premise j blakeson brilliantly expands his idea through an enlightening screenplay that tackles the sometimes cunning guardianward relationship in reallife packed with clever analogies to reallife capitalism blakeson transmits impactful messages about the power of authority excessive ambition and the moral compromises one makes to gain wealth and success at the cost of other peoples freedom rosamund pike impeccably leads a film that starts as a realistic take on the process of acquiring and profiting from a new victim and then evolves into an absolutely crazy second half of absurd outcomes this ridiculous development does get a bit too irrational but its purposeful objective of demonstrating capitalists immorally ruthless behavior regarding competition is undoubtedly accomplished outstanding performances across the board and a surprisingly effective electronic score only make this movie better i couldnt recommend it more ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog after years of outstanding effort from passionate fans warner bros finally decided to give zack snyder the opportunity to finish his movie on his own terms 2017s justice league went through massive production issues  explained in my review of said film  and despite years of extremely tiresome toxic discourse on social media the famous snyder cut got a controversyinducing budget to complete an undoubtedly unfinished cut a crucial disclaimer youll see countless reviews based on wholly different approaches some people will review it as a standalone regular movie while others will look at it as an extended alternate cut of a film previously released im part of the latter group of reviewers i find it a bit unfair to criticize pacing issues or an overlong runtime when the purpose of this cut is precisely to show everything snyder had in his hand director extended ultimate cut call it what you feel its appropriate but its a fourhour movie so many scenes will inevitably drag or feel unnecessary and irrelevant the narrative is fundamentally the same which means the audience knows whats coming from a general perspective still im reviewing this version mostly on its own merits but without forgetting that its not a regular theatrical film and that it unquestionably builds upon what was already released without getting into spoilers i do have to write this the heavy marketing was incredibly misleading and i dont doubt for a second that many fans will feel disappointed regarding certain story points and particular characters the whole its a totally distinct movie or joss whedon only used 10 of snyders footage were nothing more than false publicity for a cut that honestly didnt need it out of the 119 minutes of the 2017s version probably around 80 90 minutes are also in the snyder cut which will be surprising for people who expected something entirely unique the base of the narrative is identical most scenes are just extended versions of the original but there are a couple of significant new changes that ultimately make zack snyders justice league better than its predecessor the most impactful modification that drastically changes the emotional core of the film is about cyborg ray fishers character goes from barely having any remotely significant screentime in 2017 to being the heart and soul of the movie from his backstory to the development across the runtime cyborg is undoubtedly the superhero that gains the most with this cut leaving as a complete compelling character who i genuinely cared for on the other hand aquaman and the flash receive similar introductory scenes with batman barely getting any sort of new individual growth besides more action sequences however once the league is assembled the character interactions increase improving their team spirit and deeply elevating the us united storyline the humor and tone remain lighter than in other snyder films clearly something that the filmmaker always had in mind for his version whedon only added a couple of more jokes since most of them are present in this cut  the intimidating runtime does negatively affect the overall pacing but the longer buildups and extensive dialogue scenes make the full movie much more cohesive and coherent compared to the originals abrupt awful editing work the snyder cut has a tremendously better flow giving time for information to sink in and characters to get used to each other i rather watch an overlong film with a wellbuilt story than the complete contrary some color changes and tone adjustments also improve the movies consistency storywise besides the fantastic arc given to cyborg there are a couple of changes that heavily affect either a particular character or a secondary storyline but when it comes to the main narrative its more or less about the same every action sequence with preexistent footage is visually improved and extended with scenes not seen before but the new vfx are as hitandmiss as junkie xls score the latter mixes up so many different types of tracks and music that it genuinely becomes a tad confusing while some scenes get an absolutely perfect epic soundtrack others receive weird outofplace music distracting the scene itself theres only one change i definitely dislike the r rating brings horribly artificial forced blood splashes and outofnowhere cursing that simply dont belong in the film i know snyder loves his gritty bloody gory action  as do i  but either the whole movie is consistent with this type of action or some scenes will feel like they come from a wholly separate film a few bloody sequences work well enough but most just feel notably forced while the cursing feels ridiculously outofcharacter at points its by far the most incompatible aspect of the cut but admittedly one that doesnt heavily impact my opinion a common issue i have with extended cuts is that these mostly add and rarely remove snyder cut partially breaks that rule removing some scenes from the 2017s version supposedly only whedons footage which some people wrongly believe to be almost the entire movie  while most of the decisions regarding this process are efficient theres a couple of them that not only dont improve the respective storylines but actually make them less powerful than the theatrical film for example in snyder cut the bringing superman back arc lacks an important characters take on the situation having in mind that characters past it actually feels a bit outofcharacter that the viewers dont get to see what that person thinks about a potentially devastating action regarding steppenwolf his design looks better than the terrible original and his motivations are clearer but unfortunately he remains a generic cgi punching bag for our superheroes his dynamic armor is packed with spikes but its really one of those designs with visual impact only since it has no effect whatsoever in battle i cant get into spoilers about darkseid or desaad but i can safely write that these characters are nothing more than fanservice just like joker jared leto  the ending is definitely the sequence that changes the most due to the addition of dozens of new extended action scenes and it does play out differently  though the conclusion is essentially the same  leaving the viewers with a menacing threat on the horizon zack snyders justice league is arguably a more cohesive consistent and emotionally compelling movie than the 2017s version as expected its fourhour runtime causes pacing issues and possesses dozens of unnecessary irrelevant scenes but criticizing these aspects in an admittedly nontheatrical cut is unfairly defeating its purpose despite most of the original justice league being present in the snyder cut  something that might surprise a few fans  the main narrative is built and developed through a structure that flows tremendously better than the previous edition cyborg becoming the emotional core of the story and the increased character interactions are some of the best changes zack snyder and chris terrio did the extended action sequences are more riveting and preexistent footage is definitely improved but the new vfx are as erratic as junkie xls allovertheplace score the rrating is the only straightup negative aspect that damages the film with highly forced fakelooking blood and rare yet cringeworthy cursing highly anticipated characters and or storylines are better described as unimpactful fanservice but overall most of the decisions made vastly improve upon what was already built in the end i sincerely expect a significant majority of the fandom to get their expectations fulfilled and i hope that the dceu continues with snyder involved  just as long as the studios leave filmmakers to do their job without nonsensical restrictions ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog  quentin tarantino is one of the best filmmakers of alltime he has undeniable talent behind the camera and his movies are fated to leave a mark in each year theyre released in addition to that hes also an extraordinary screenwriter as once upon a time in hollywood proves once again his knowledge of the early decades of film is vast so every feature he produces is always going to be filled with references to those fairy tale years and thats precisely what this movie is a fairy tale in hollywood hence its title let me just leave this here right off the bat im not going to address any controversy surrounding this film namely the whole bruce lee depiction and the manson family in general  as im always fair and impartial to the movie im reviewing moving on my knowledge of the 60s isnt that good obviously i know the whole sharon tate story as well as the famous manson murders but when it comes to actual films from that decade well probably i only know a few by name a classic scene or a memorable soundtrack tarantino uses his large runtime to place tons of references to that period and thats one of the reasons the first act of the movie drags theres a lot of time spent with characters just driving cars while listening to music references in the songs  wide shots of the city as they drive by references in the buildings  or even just playing an lp and dancing to it reference in the songs again  i understand that these mean something but if they dont develop the character in any way then these are just easter eggs and have no impact on the actual narrative the first hour or so is filled with sequences which sole purpose is to show how much tarantino knows about that time and theres nothing wrong with it as long as it tells a story thats the second issue i have with the first act it takes too long to establish its characters and theres no apparent objective within the story it feels like a person just strolling around with no destination which in itself isnt a bad thing but if you put together repetitive sequences plus a story that no one knows where its going or how it connects to the only thing people are actually expecting the sharon tate event  then youll bore the hell out of the audience a lot of people constantly left my theater to get more food or something and they werent in a hurry  nevertheless from the moment we start understanding who rick dalton and cliff booth are what they do what they did and what they want with their lives then the film becomes incredibly captivating its definitely a characterdriven story its a fairy tale where rick tries his best to overcome his own personal issues to be the very best movie star after being on an exponentially negative path cliff as his stunt double lives off of his buddy by doing everything he needs around the house and everywhere else these two are inseparable and their scenes are always filled with laughter and joy even in the darkest moments ouatih works because of its beautifullywritten characters if you dont care about them then you wont enjoy the film at all in addition to this if you dont know anything regarding the art of filmmaking then youll probably hate it since it will become extremely dull its one of those movies that anyone can like however for someone who knows and understands how films are made it will always be a better time at the theater you can love this movie sure but if you love filmmaking and you have knowledge of its techniques youll love it even more there are so many technical achievements worthy of appreciation that i cant get to all of them so ill just address two of my favorites the first has to be the blackandwhite flicks inside the actual film putting leonardo dicaprio acting on classic westerns with overthetop performances is an absolute delight watching those features in a 43 blackandwhite screen filled with classic sound effects and cheesy oneliners wonderful the second allows for my favorite scenes of the whole movie the extensive onetake dialogues i mean 10 or 15minute sequences where dicaprio just gives it his all this is how every single film should be done theres even a joke in the movie where rick criticizes a particular type of filmmaking because they would film every character separately saying their lines and then editing them together unfortunately thats how most features are done today therefore from watching a simple dialogue scene with dicaprio and julia butters a 10yearold little girl to a bar sequence which belongs to a movie rick is filming this one even has rick asking his lines and the camera has to go back to its starting point  everything with no cuts whatsoever what can i ask more from a director obviously if this is a characterdriven narrative the cast has to be genuinely compelling leonardo dicaprio brad pitt margot robbie i mean do i even need to explain how phenomenal they are dicaprio proves once again hes one of the greatest actors of alltime the ability that he has to put 200 in every single scene is unbelievable i even started to tear up once his character is able to find his footing solely due to the actors performance the oscar nom is guaranteed lets see about the win brad pitt also has tons of nominations on his lap with an astonishing supporting display he has a subtle performance but its pretty incredible how much he can transmit to the audience by putting apparently so little effort margot robbie doesnt have that much screentime but her character had the simple objective of showing how glamorous and dreamy an actress life could be at that time so she didnt exactly need to deliver her agame its always good to see al pacino marvin schwarz onscreen and im thrilled that margaret qualley pussycat  who i know from the leftovers one of the most underrated tv shows of the century  is finally getting some recognition technically like i said above its close to a masterpiece its tarantino everyone knows what hes capable of but having in mind his most recent features its a pleasant surprise and evidence of quality to the naysayers that he was able to produce a film with less bloody action there are terrific demonstrations of great cinematography robert richardson  and the editing is always impeccable in tarantinos features this time due to fred raskin  the score is addictive and it carries a very significant role in the movie i would say that if tarantino was able to shorten its runtime and control its pacing better this would be a technically perfect film all in all once upon a time in hollywood isnt the best quentin tarantinos movie but its undoubtedly one of the years best filled with awardwinning lead performances second oscar for dicaprio please  this characterdriven story is packed with references to the 60s which will be the divisive point in whether people will enjoy the film or not its first act is slow and takes too long to set up its story but from the moment its able to find its footing its an entertaining ride if you love filmmaking and you know the insides of the art tarantino delivers a nearperfect technical production its alternate ending to reallife events is meant to be controversial but for me its a vision of how everything should have happened if the world was fair or indeed a fairy tale in hollywood ",

getting a best visual effects nomination and its probably going to win calling it now there are no words that can describe how immersive realistic and groundbreaking the imax 3d experience is weta digital is undoubtedly the most incredible vfx cgi company since the beginning of this millennium from the lord of the rings trilogy to the avatar movie s and through the most famous tv series of this time game of thrones peter jacksons company keeps surpassing the impossible alita is a mix of rosa salazars motioncapture performance and cgi animation and its the most beautiful thing ive seen in a long time visuals are not the most important aspect of a film theyre not even the key technical feature the story and characters are and always will be the necessary ingredients for a movies success that said im also the first to defend that without remarkable technical achievements a film wont ever go above very good if you want a movie to be one of the best of the year a combination of compelling story characters and great filmmaking attributes is essential robert rodriguezs film nails the latter requirement but has a lot of hits and misses regarding the former like i wrote above i have no vocabulary to describe how mindblowing and eyegasmic this movie looks if youre intrigued by how fascinated i am you know what to do buy an imax ticket and watch it the visuals alone compensate for the price of admission besides the jawdropping vfx the sound and production design are unbelievable i could feel every punch kick or scream like i rarely feel with other highbudget films the amount of work that went in to build this world is worthy of recognition and i honestly hope that by the end of this year alita is receiving a whole bunch of nominations for its aesthetics i love how animelike this feels i didnt read the original manga but you will like this movie more if youre a fan of anime rodriguez does a seamless job bringing iron city to life and there are tons of nods to how anime stories flow which will surely please fans of said genre sadly the screenplay isnt exactly written as it should be one of the most emotive moments of the film trusts the audience to buy into the romance displayed onscreen but since it feels very forced from the getgo this unnecessary subplot carries too much influence on the end result in addition to this james cameron and his team took a quite questionable decision concerning the main plot having in mind the marketing surrounding this blockbuster its still a minor spoiler so i cant really delve into details but ill write this the closest the movie gets to its third act the more worried i became from the moment the second acts ends i start realizing something that not a single person working on this film even hinted at and that was the worst call they could have ever made not only it dragged the first half of the movie but it deeply damaged its narrative once you see this film youll understand what im talking about youll get me when i say that the marketing strategy for alita battle angel ruined its story and it will definitely make a lot of people leave the theater frustrated just like i did hopefully this was just a misstep that doesnt affect its box office because this is a movie worthy of watching at a movie theater and only at such place yes it does have issues with its storytelling it has a whole world that doesnt fit in just a 2hour flick so the plot becomes convoluted and a bit slow however i do think critics are being too harsh alita is one of the most complex intriguing and wellwritten characters of the last few years while the screenplay contains fundamental writing flaws its main protagonist is flawless despite still feeling a bit frustrated i want to rewatch this movie so bad just to get another opportunity to follow alita throughout her journey i love characterdriven narratives especially when the character in question is such a compelling one rosa salazar delivers an amazing mocap performance the academy wants a new category well best motioncapture performance suits your ceremony like a glove  alita and salazar share resemblances that can only be achieved with the unique camerasetup and technology that the production team had at their display which is something pretty outstanding christoph waltz brilliantly portrays ido as expected from such a highcaliber actor mahershala ali vector and jennifer connelly chiren are underused but they make their characters work for the story keean johnson is fine as hugo but hes connected to one of the films major issues everyone else is pretty great each performance elevates their respective character which helps move the plot forward however it all goes back to salazars remarkable performance and the way she and alita carried the whole thing to safe harbor hollywood put your eyes on this girl finally the action oh my god the action scenes are some of the most entertaining riveting and thrilling sequences ive seen since mission impossible  fallout while the latter based its action on real jawdropping stunts alita battle angel probably delivers some of the best animated action ever the motorball sequences are impossible of getting your eyes offscreen and the fights that alita goes through are so wellcrafted honestly im even scared of how these look in regular 2d i doubt they feel seamless and flow as perfect as they do in imax 3d so be careful with which choice you make in my opinion alita battle angel is one of those movies that you have to watch at a movie theater especially on imax 3d you will not be able to grasp or feel the astonishingly immersive world that james cameron produced nor the powerful sound design its visuals effects are groundbreaking and i promise youve never seen such a mixture of real and animation like this beautiful or gorgeous are not adjectives enough to describe the world where alita lives its a visual experience so do waste your time and money in supporting this film i cant deny neither its storytelling problems or the damaging marketing surrounding this blockbuster however rosa salazars terrific performance and alita as the protagonist are more than enough reasons to make you feel entertained and captivated until the very end the action is mindblowing and im not lying when i state that it contains some of the best animated sequences ever i left the theater frustrated but i cant wait to see it again on the big screen alita alone deserves that effort  ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog charlie kaufman is undeniably one of the greatest writers of the 2000s being john malkovich and eternal sunshine of the spotless mind are some of his most notable works but its synecdoche new york thats considered by many as one of the best films of the respective decade therefore i was obviously excited about his return to liveaction movies since 2008 hes only made the animated feature anomalisa  im thinking of ending things boasts an incredibly talented cast capable of seating me down and make me watch any film they participate in even though jessie buckley dolittle is sort of a new face to me my expectations were moderately high so how did it go im not going to lie i found this movie so intricate that i had a really hard time figuring it all out as soon as it ended i knew i didnt understand it in full which generated an unusual yet refreshing feeling inside me i felt the need to not only think about the film all night but since i didnt have the time to watch it again i returned to a few specific scenes in the next morning i also researched a bit and talked with a fellow critic to settle some of my minds internal debates i write this to imply that this is not an easy movie to decipher which will definitely throw some people off its a film that requires all of the viewers attention and selfquestioning capability otherwise things will get complicated as usual im not sharing any spoilers so ill keep my opinion about the storys multiple interpretations to the bare minimum of all the numerous ways of explaining this movie i found two either from jessie buckleys characters perspective or from jesse plemons i like both for different reasons in terms of logic which every viewer will struggle to find plemons character is the key to understand the remarkably complex multilayered narrative looking at the film from his perspective everything makes much more sense however its surprisingly from buckleys view that i find the movies message to be more interesting and likely to resonate with most people making an impactful move in life requires determination courage decisiveness moving to another country switching jobs ending a relationship all can be extremely demanding and psychologically painful im thinking of ending things brilliantly demonstrates how one can delay these actions sometimes indefinitely from the excruciatingly long car drives almost an hour of the runtime is spent inside the car listening to the main characters debating apparently random philosophical themes to the enigmatic transitions of time passing by kaufmans screenplay keeps transmitting a message of how people are stationary and time just keeps flowing this film takes ambiguousness and metaphoric filmmaking to a whole other level not only everything the viewer is seeing has in some shape or form a philosophical meaning but the dialogues between the main characters are themselves about cultural intellectual sophisticated matters some of these conversations have an eventual impact in the narrative or in the characters some just feel like kaufman needed to express his thoughts on several subjects with a runtime of slightly over two hours this movie overstays its welcome a bit due to the insistence in delivering repetitive similar scenes with the same goal the time shenanigans performed in the parents house is undoubtedly intriguing but its more distracting than helpful storywise having in mind the already puzzling narrative the confusion associated with understanding how time works only creates even more doubts it also deviates the viewers attention from the real focus which didnt help my first viewing in fact i was so concentrated trying to comprehend the purpose behind the oldyoung versions of the characters that i completely lost track of the runtime ultimately thinking the film was near its ending when it still had forty minutes to go theres a limit to how abstract and implicit a movie can be without becoming genuinely hard to understand and kaufman walks that threshold successful sometimes not that much in other moments nevertheless i can only share compliments from now on firstly the cast ive been in love with anything toni collette does since hereditary and once again shes weirdly captivating as an amusing yet disturbing mother david thewlis offers a subtler performance as well as jesse plemons even though the latter explodes with emotion in the third act however jessie buckley steals the spotlight in impeccable fashion like i mentioned in the beginning i know very little of her as an actress but ill make sure to add her to the list of actresses to follow closely with one of the biggest emotional ranges seen this year she delivers an incredibly captivating display one that should guarantee her name in future contenders list for the awards season from citing entire poems to fiercely debating any topic thrown at her by plemons her commitment to the role is palpable an astonishing performance that i will remember for a long time however its in the technical realm that this film achieves perfection without the shadow of a doubt this is the best movie of the year when it comes to the technical attributes until the date of this review obviously  almost every filmmaking element carries a tremendous impact in either the narrative or its characters the purposefully rough editing robert frazen adds to the perplexing atmosphere the lighting plus the production molly hughes and set design mattie siegal help identify where a particular event is happening the detailed costume design melissa toth and the impressive makeup are vital to the understanding of everything that occurs in the parents house the distinct cinematography ukasz al elevates every single action performed by the characters its a technically flawless film and i wouldnt be surprised to see it being nominated for several categories when the time comes im thinking of ending things might be a netflix original movie but it screams a24 all the way from the incredibly perplexing narrative told through bizarre storytelling to its distinctly unconventional technical characteristics charlie kaufman offers a remarkably complex film that can take different interpretations and may require more than one viewing  his insistence in transmitting one of the films messages through neverending philosophical conversations and confusing timebending distractions stretch the story to an unnecessary long runtime that hurts the overall piece nevertheless all messages are successfully delivered through an intriguing headscratching weirdly captivating story packed with cultural debates and unique characters an absolutely outstanding jessie buckley elevates every single line of dialogue showing tremendous emotional range but the impressively talented cast also improves the multilayered screenplay technically it is and it will remain as one of the best movies of the year every technical aspect is close to perfection and almost all have a massive impact on the story and how the viewer interprets it it will undoubtedly create a gap between critics and audiences since it has all the ingredients that usually place these groups at opposite extremes i can only recommend it to people who are able to dedicate their full attention to what theyre watching while being capable of selfquestioning its not your usual netflix flick to pop during tedious home tasks to help pass the time so make sure you know what youre getting into ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog so a little bit about me first i was always a man of science i have a masters degree in electronics and telecommunications engineering and i was always fascinated by how things truly work on the other hand im not the biggest fan of biographical movies due to the genres boundaries these films often follow a generic script filled with formulaic plot points and lacking imaginative storytelling therefore i usually analyze these movies based on a single question do i know more about the character and or the story that made him her famous now that ive watched this flick another aspect thats important in any film but even more in this genre the actor who interprets the protagonist radioactive possesses rosamund pike as the magnificent marie curie if theres one undeniably incredible element in this feature its pikes brilliant performance as the famous scientist now i have no idea how marie was as a person so i cant really evaluate pikes display regarding how accurate she is on a personal level nevertheless her impressive emotional range can easily get her a few nominations when the awards season comes around when it comes to which expressions to use or how strong her emotions need to be pike manages to always choose the most coherent option having in mind the character she portrays sam riley shares great chemistry with pike delivering a couple of genuinely passionate moments and witty conversations anya taylorjoy ir ne curie  who i forgot was also in the movie is always a delight to see on screen and in this case a very welcome surprise however this film is so focused on its protagonist as it should be  that every character and actor other than the main one ends up being utterly forgettable nothing wrong with this  technically i need to praise the makeup artists who did a terrific job getting pike older throughout the runtime as time flows accordingly evgueni and sacha galperines score is simple yet sweet enough to slightly elevate a few sequences unfortunately radioactive holds more than just a few minor issues my biggest gripe is related to how everything is put together i doubt most people will watch this movie with the hope of seeing more of marie curies personal relationships this isnt exactly a romantic drama having in mind the discoveries that she made i was extremely interested in watching how in fact she discovered radioactivity of course im not expecting the film to turn into a highly detailed chemistry lesson and all of its specifics but marjane satrapi rushes through most of the relevant moments or skips them entirely maries first groundbreaking result is so casually presented to the viewer that it makes the whole thing far from being a big deal which it is  there are a couple of visually captivating animated sequences that sort of explain the process that the characters are going to perform but its still quite underwhelming and disappointing i still have dozens of questions now which i hoped the movie would answer but didnt its also edited st phane roche in such an uneasy manner that it feels like im watching two completely different films i dont know if this was satrapi or jack thornes screenwriter idea but showing mostly adverse future events directly related to maries discoveries didnt work for me at all you know how these movies tend to have some sort of information shown before credits explaining how things worked out in reallife its like they picked them up and randomly spread them across the film the focus went fullon to the protagonists personal life instead of balancing it with her worldchanging experiments answering my question above i did learn more about marie curie but not about what i wished to know about her ultimately it feels like this biographical work doesnt honor her legacy just as an example the story brushes over her discoveries so fast that it doesnt even explain the reasons behind the nomenclature of the new elements overall its not worthy of being the biography of the scientists life radioactive boasts an absolutely outstanding rosamund pike as the great marie curie but marjane satrapi director  jack thorne screenwriter  and st phane roche film editor fail to deliver a wellstructured narrative rushing through the scientists groundbreaking discoveries and experiments or ignoring them altogether randomly mixing up future catastrophes with the actual story not only breaks both the tone and pacing of the movie but it also makes the whole viewing a bit uneasy despite her personal life always being a point of interest her work and how she performed it are why most people want to watch this film to learn more about her contributions to the world of today unfortunately curies legacy is remitted to a bythenumbers biographical work restricted by the genres formulaic tropes a neat score by the galperine brothers and a couple of visually captivating animated sequences still elevate an overall disappointing feature  ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog netflix isnt exactly known for its original action films and when these occasionally appear most tend to be more comedic than focusing on the action itself spenser confidential 6 underground  however 2020 seems to be the year chosen by netflix to surprise its viewers with ruthless bloody violent action a few months ago extraction became the studios best original action flick and one of the better movies ever released from the streaming network therefore my expectations for the old guard were reasonably high having in mind that it has charlize theron as the protagonist and greg rucka as the sole screenwriter hes one of the two creators of the original comics the film is based on  overall its a pretty decent movie that could have been a lot better had it reached the potential that it possesses first of all any film that focuses more on starting a franchise than actually being a good movie sets itself up to fail miserably fortunately even though gina princebythewoods feature does establish sagaworthy lore it never makes it its number one priority in fact until the penultimate shot of the film i was genuinely worried that a certain storyline wasnt going to have closure due to the we need to save something for the sequel mentality however greg rucka clearly knows what he needed to write for the first installment of a possible franchise and what he needed to save for the following chapters the story is truly intriguing and mysterious owning deep and complex mythology that doesnt have unambiguous answers one of the aspects i love the most about ruckas narrative is how it balances the abstract and philosophical approach to immortality as weird as it might sound immortality is depicted in such a believable manner even though everything about it feels unbelievably crazy even logically all the questions one can have regarding how immortal can they be are answered in some shape or form so its evident that rucka wanted to make immortality something incredibly real and wellgrounded charlize therons character gets her past very wellexplored through flashbacks and a couple of captivating dialogues with her team andy is a tremendously easy character for the viewer to root for and her badassery definitely helps strengthen that emotional connection kiki layne is a major surprise for me she delivers an impressive performance i missed out on if beale street could talk so this makes my first time watching her on the big screen and i cant wait to see what she does next her character nile is also quite interesting to learn about she has to make extremely challenging life decisions for such a young woman making her a candidate to steal andys spotlight in the following movies which are undoubtedly happening  i wish that the screenplay packed less forced exposition but i do understand the difficulties in explaining so many rules about this world without having a few dialogues exclusively meant to deliver that information rucka and gina could have made better narrative decisions concerning a few storylines some sequences carry an immense potential that is never reached leaving me wanting a bit more from a particular character or a specific subplot the action is definitely above average but its far from the quality of extraction for example some action set pieces are really wellchoreographed and welledited terilyn a shropshire  but most employ the generic punch and cut quickly style as nitpicky as it might be for a ratedr film the gunshots didnt have the visual and audible impact that they should have being awkwardly unflashy throughout most of the runtime in the end the action is entertaining enough to make any viewer grab the popcorn bucket and eat everything nevertheless two aspects heavily damage the film the song selection is as cringeworthy as it can be im not entirely sure if the score composers volker bertelmann dustin ohalloran are the ones to blame but the excruciating insertion of an electropop song every ten minutes including midaction ruins the dark somber tone that the movie possesses and it distracts from the actual fighting the other aspect has to do with the villain i cant delve into details but gina and rucka could have created a phenomenal antagonist whose moral motivations would resonate with every viewer but instead the i want money motive made the cut all in all the old guard continues netflixs trend of original action films boasting riveting set pieces even though it doesnt quite reach extractions level some sequences are indeed wellchoreographed and welledited but most feel simply generic and just fun enough as one of the creators of the original comics greg rucka delivers a screenplay packed with intriguing lore which is wellexplored and wellestablished for what should be the first movie in a new franchise with the remarkable direction of gina princebythewood the main focus goes to making a good film instead of trying to get in as much information as possible charlize theron and kiki layne offer excellent performances as the two welldeveloped and emotionally compelling protagonists however the cringeworthy use of electropop songs throughout the whole film damages many moments for a story containing a moral dilemma at its center the choice of a moneydriven villain feels disappointing and extremely unfulfilling having in mind the antagonists potential its an entertaining action flick no doubt about it but it carried so much potential that its a shame it didnt reach half of it ",

time to review the film that started this new trilogy the force awakens at the time it was my most anticipated movie of the year and i placed it second on the list of my favorite films of 2015 just a bit below mad max fury road  so yes i do love this movie and it is definitely on the top3 of the saga the cast choices are the undoubtful proof of the huge success that this film achieved daisy ridley rey is a massive discovery her talent is limitless and she embraces her role like no other she delivers a very emotional and powerful display showing all of her acting skills i can feel that she is 100 committed to her character and what a character to portray at your first big movie appearance rey is excellentlydeveloped throughout the film she might mislead people into thinking she is just a mere scavenger but once the movie gets going she becomes an awesome character sharing some of the most epic moments in the whole runtime she has an oddly mysterious backstory which is going to produce theories and plot twists that i cant wait for in the next films john boyega finn is a fantastic supporting actor and another great casting he brings just the right amount of humor with some exceptionally delivered lines and his facial expressions and timing are perfect finn is going to be one of the audiences favorites for sure his journey to encounter rey is interesting and unique in the saga in my opinion it is his story that carries the beginning of the movie and that sets up a lot of characters and plot points adam driver as kylo ren  oh my god what a performance driver is so subtle in the most meaningful moments but so compelling in the most menacing ones he elevates ren into a phenomenal antagonist with a splendidly written script jj abrams and co do a wonderful job writing both the plot and the characters kylo ren stands out he is a multilayered character with so much untold and hidden behind his personality and intriguing past once again there are many theories and plot twists ahead that im drooling to know which one they are going to follow with oscar isaac is very exciting as poe dameron another fabulous addition to the franchise his character creates an honest bond with finn and their interactions are pretty cool they share some amazing scenes and poe has all of the awesome xwing fights which are outstanding supreme leader snoke andy serkis does not show up that much but he definitely is a very threatening presence and a very well achieved motion capture work as for the original cast characters harrison ford has one of his best performances in the more recent years han solo is one of his most popular characters and he portrays him flawlessly carrie fisher returns as leia and she offers a touch of reality to all of this every time she is on screen everything becomes more realistic and tangible due to her graceful and humble display chewbacca has the usual funny dialogues with solo and some glorious action set pieces bb8 is what people feared the most since he could easily be annoying or irrelevant thankfully he is another checkbox on the list of marvelous additions to the star wars universe it is mindblowing how a droid can provide so much laughter and terrific action scenes he is unquestionably a toy worth spending your money on for christmas c3po also appears and elevates the level of nostalgia that everyone is already full of moving to the technical aspects of the film jj abrams proves himself to every single person that doubted him since he is the main reason why this movie is one of the greats from the seamless editing to the great camera work during the impressive action sequences he enhances the story so much with his distinct use of visual storytelling it feels like a real film and not just a star wars typical movie the visual effects are top notch and the cinematography could not be better due to the unbelievable practical backgrounds abrams uses a lot of long wide shots with beautiful landscapes and mostly everything is real besides the obvious there is very few cgi less than you probably think  which transforms every scene every shot into something more special the tone is very well balanced between comedy and action the storytelling process is astonishingly well handled and the pacing always maintains the tremendous excitement one of the common issues of all star wars films are the excessive exposition scenes well jj massively improves on that aspect having just a couple of them and i am counting the traditional text that starts the movie like i said above there is an extensive use of visual storytelling in other words everything that you see is giving you information while advancing the plot without actually literally telling you what is going on or what is going to happen john williams score continues to superbly accompany every scene not only the action ones but it also strengthens dialogues i love the ending but here is where both fans and critics are going to become very divisive it ends with a huge cliffhanger and some people are going to be disappointed because they are left with this feeling of unfulfillment and if you dont know how to deal with it you might think you didnt enjoy the film the truth is you cant have everything right now this is a trilogy so it is absurd to even expect that you are going to have everything that you wish for in the first movie of a new era i wanted more from the second the film finished i also felt a bit let down because the movie concludes with something i had been expecting forever however this is a great feeling to have because it means the film meant something it means the movie was so amazing that i just cant wait anymore for the next one nevertheless the force awakens cant escape some minor flaws while pretty much every single character is great maz kanata lupita nyongo is not with so much practical effects surrounding every environment a 100 cgi character is going to negatively standout besides the whole subplot involving meeting with maz feels a bit unnecessary and the story could have easily progressed without her however my main issue with this film is its lack of originality when it comes to creating a new actual danger for the galaxy i mean the starkiller base is essentially another death star just bigger  really they couldnt figure out anything else besides another giant planet destroyer it does not reflect jj abrams incredible direction and the production teams excellent work at all finally there are some problems that i dont yet know if they are in fact problems this is the first movie of the trilogy and some things happened that i dont know how or why they did so i cant really fault the screenplay  yet we all know the huge plot device that episode iv  a new hope 1977 supposedly had for decades but then rogue one a star wars story 2016 was released and brilliantly solved what was already considered an internet meme this film does not have such a massive plot device but there is one little moment that occurs in the first act that i still dont know if it is in fact a flaw or if there is an explanation waiting for us in the next movies all in all the force awakens proves that the star wars franchise is still very much alive this is easily one of the best films of 2015 and one of the best in the franchise it features an outstanding cast with some excellent performances from the new actors joining the saga and powerfully nostalgic displays from the original members incrediblydeveloped characters carry this movie with the help of a mysterious and captivating screenplay as well as a lot of visually exciting action sequences jj abrams has his stamp all over the film with beautiful wide shots massive practical effects and exceptional use of visual storytelling a cheap third death star and some very minor issues here and there dont allow the movie to shine flawlessly but it is still freaking awesome it undoubtedly belongs to my top3

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog ive always questioned myself why the conjuring universe possesses more spinoffs than main titles since the conjuring and the conjuring 2 are by far the best films of the popular horror franchise looking at the numbers the nun holds the box office record being the most successful movie of the saga financially but ironically enough its also the most disliked film by both critics and audience members the viral marketing campaign obviously hyped this spinoff to an unbelievable level of expectation but its still strange that it took five years to deliver another the conjuring flick since both previous installments were tremendously profitable as well with james wan out of the directors chair and without a screenplay credit my expectations werent exactly high wan is one of the main reasons why the conjuring movies work so well from his ability to generate an enormous amount of suspense to the actually scary atmosphere wan is definitely one of the best horror directors of the last decade therefore replacing him would always be a challenging task michael chaves directed the curse of la llorona a generic bland horror flick that didnt have a single surprising element however i did compliment chaves work with the horror sequences since i did find them somewhat effective so i was still feeling optimistic about the devil made me do it its admittedly the weakest film of the trilogy but its still far from the awful annabelle comes home or the hideous origin story about the famous nun when it comes to the main titles the exceptional production value is something all have in common in fact this latest flick is arguably the bestlooking one the horror sequences look stunning on the big screen and the sound design is extremely impactful as always its worth remembering that this franchise doesnt waste hundreds of millions to make its movies being a relatively lowbudget cinematic universe especially when compared to every other studios massive sagas practical effects are always the goto if possible keeping the use of cgi to the minimum actingwise its also where these films triumph patrick wilson and vera farmiga share palpable chemistry deeply elevating their characters emotional connection at its core the conjuring features a love story between ed and lorraine warren ultimately being their grounded convincing loving relationship that keeps the viewers interested in the least based on a true story events both actors deliver remarkable performances as does the legendary john noble the lord of the rings fringe as a former priest i didnt know about his casting before the movie so i was genuinely surprised by seeing noble on the big screen again hes absolutely phenomenal as expected and quite creepy as a mysterious character everyone else is decent enough but i dont find any other interpretation worth noting unfortunately this is as far as i can go complimentwise the primary narrative surrounding the actual case that gives the name to the film is nowhere near as interesting as the stories told in the previous the conjuring movies the case itself doesnt have much to tell so the majority of the film rests on following the beloved couple going on side quests as detectives eventually the clues found are connected to the main plot but overall david leslie johnsonmcgoldricks screenplay isnt that captivating despite the predictability and formulaic horror elements theres a rather enjoyable twist to the whole demon possession routine that marks the entire franchise the biggest disappointment is something i feared would happen without james wan at the helm the once terrifying suspenseful atmosphere during the effective creative jumpscare sequences now gives place to the generic buildup that viewers experience in some of the cheapest horror movies of today due to a characters health issue the tension levels are constantly high for this person in particular but for most of the runtime the general environment lacks the essential scary feeling the jumpscares look lazy and too obvious a cliche that the conjuring films fought hard to distance themselves from in addition to this its a much darker movie than the rest in terms of lighting finally i have mixed feelings about the ending without spoiling it of course its similar to a quiet place part ii in the sense that two different sequences need to be edited together seamlessly so the viewers can easily follow whats happening without losing the tension and suspense one of these scenes is particularly shaky repetitive and overly dark which definitely left me a bit disappointed peter gvozdas and christian wagners editing is really good though michael burgess cinematography offers a couple of gorgeous shots and joseph bisharas score maintains the ominous tone of the franchise james wan is clearly missed but michael chaves didnt do a bad job the conjuring the devil made me do it is undoubtedly the weakest installment of the trilogy but its still quite far from the awful level of the worst films of the horror franchise boasting the trademark terrific production value of the saga patrick wilson and vera farmiga deliver outstanding lead performances as the only two emotionally compelling characters overall every element is lesser than the previous the conjuring movies from the less scary atmosphere to the unimaginative generic jumpscares michael chaves isnt able to replicate james wans tremendous levels of suspense and tension despite a brilliant opening sequence david leslie johnsonmcgoldricks screenplay focuses on many storylines indirectly connected to the main plot ending up with a notthatinteresting narrative that doesnt quite justify the main title some technical attributes mainly the editing and cinematography as well as sound design compensate with some entertainment in the end i still recommend it to fans of the cinematic universe and lovers of the horror genre ",

than focusing on the action itself spenser confidential 6 underground  however 2020 seems to be the year chosen by netflix to surprise its viewers with ruthless bloody violent action a few months ago extraction became the studios best original action flick and one of the better movies ever released from the streaming network therefore my expectations for the old guard were reasonably high having in mind that it has charlize theron as the protagonist and greg rucka as the sole screenwriter hes one of the two creators of the original comics the film is based on  overall its a pretty decent movie that could have been a lot better had it reached the potential that it possesses first of all any film that focuses more on starting a franchise than actually being a good movie sets itself up to fail miserably fortunately even though gina princebythewoods feature does establish sagaworthy lore it never makes it its number one priority in fact until the penultimate shot of the film i was genuinely worried that a certain storyline wasnt going to have closure due to the we need to save something for the sequel mentality however greg rucka clearly knows what he needed to write for the first installment of a possible franchise and what he needed to save for the following chapters the story is truly intriguing and mysterious owning deep and complex mythology that doesnt have unambiguous answers one of the aspects i love the most about ruckas narrative is how it balances the abstract and philosophical approach to immortality as weird as it might sound immortality is depicted in such a believable manner even though everything about it feels unbelievably crazy even logically all the questions one can have regarding how immortal can they be are answered in some shape or form so its evident that rucka wanted to make immortality something incredibly real and wellgrounded charlize therons character gets her past very wellexplored through flashbacks and a couple of captivating dialogues with her team andy is a tremendously easy character for the viewer to root for and her badassery definitely helps strengthen that emotional connection kiki layne is a major surprise for me she delivers an impressive performance i missed out on if beale street could talk so this makes my first time watching her on the big screen and i cant wait to see what she does next her character nile is also quite interesting to learn about she has to make extremely challenging life decisions for such a young woman making her a candidate to steal andys spotlight in the following movies which are undoubtedly happening  i wish that the screenplay packed less forced exposition but i do understand the difficulties in explaining so many rules about this world without having a few dialogues exclusively meant to deliver that information rucka and gina could have made better narrative decisions concerning a few storylines some sequences carry an immense potential that is never reached leaving me wanting a bit more from a particular character or a specific subplot the action is definitely above average but its far from the quality of extraction for example some action set pieces are really wellchoreographed and welledited terilyn a shropshire  but most employ the generic punch and cut quickly style as nitpicky as it might be for a ratedr film the gunshots didnt have the visual and audible impact that they should have being awkwardly unflashy throughout most of the runtime in the end the action is entertaining enough to make any viewer grab the popcorn bucket and eat everything nevertheless two aspects heavily damage the film the song selection is as cringeworthy as it can be im not entirely sure if the score composers volker bertelmann dustin ohalloran are the ones to blame but the excruciating insertion of an electropop song every ten minutes including midaction ruins the dark somber tone that the movie possesses and it distracts from the actual fighting the other aspect has to do with the villain i cant delve into details but gina and rucka could have created a phenomenal antagonist whose moral motivations would resonate with every viewer but instead the i want money motive made the cut all in all the old guard continues netflixs trend of original action films boasting riveting set pieces even though it doesnt quite reach extractions level some sequences are indeed wellchoreographed and welledited but most feel simply generic and just fun enough as one of the creators of the original comics greg rucka delivers a screenplay packed with intriguing lore which is wellexplored and wellestablished for what should be the first movie in a new franchise with the remarkable direction of gina princebythewood the main focus goes to making a good film instead of trying to get in as much information as possible charlize theron and kiki layne offer excellent performances as the two welldeveloped and emotionally compelling protagonists however the cringeworthy use of electropop songs throughout the whole film damages many moments for a story containing a moral dilemma at its center the choice of a moneydriven villain feels disappointing and extremely unfulfilling having in mind the antagonists potential its an entertaining action flick no doubt about it but it carried so much potential that its a shame it didnt reach half of it ",

cinematic adaptation which leads me to the following shameful statement ive never seen the famous alfred hitchcocks version of this story nor have i read the novel but i firmly defend that this doesnt matter  its the only film of hitchcocks filmography to have received the best picture award so i admit that im much at fault here however ben wheatley isnt directing a remake of the original movie but rather another adaptation of the also incredibly popular novel i was intrigued by the premise and the cast is definitely convincing so how did it go if i had to choose one word to ultimately describe rebecca right now it would probably be weird more on this in a bit starting with the positives armie hammer and lily james share such vivid chemistry that it elevates the surprisingly compelling bond that their characters form i write surprisingly because im not easily engaged in most romantic relationships in films whether these are straightup romances or mixed up with other genres like comedy or as in this case horror thriller nevertheless lily and armie are able to capture perfectly the growing love interest in one another through the first act which is entirely dedicated to develop and nurture the key relationship of the movie this is something i sincerely appreciate when filmmakers know how to control pacing and how much time should a particular character or storyline receive of buildup wheatley does an impressive job during the first half of the film by moving the characters and plot forward at the precise moment they need to this allows the viewer to understand what the characters are genuinely feeling and why some narrative decisions are made that change the course of the story lily james offers a remarkable performance just like armie hammer kristin scott thomas is also excellent even though her character is part of my problems with the movie however its the production design that stands out the beautiful colors and striking landscapes of the french riviera fill the screen with luxury and harmony during the naturally passionate beginning of the relationship once the narrative moves to manderley the tone changes to a gradually more depressing dark environment accompanied by a creepy score clint mansell  and spooky nightmares the adequate costumes also help to set the atmosphere but the beginning of the second half is where things start to get extremely weird from the very first moment the viewer sets place in manderley something is noticeably not right everyone addresses the late wife rebecca as the most perfect human being to ever exist reaching godlike compliments in a clear attempt of trying to create the cliche previous wife was amazing new one is awful lets make her life a living hell storyline an expected development with exaggeratedly positive comments from the staff however its the horror vibe that embraces the mansion that drives me nuts wheatley sets a dark mysterious even supernatural environment surrounding the house a definitely intriguing aspect that leads to a hugely disappointing hollow unsatisfactory conclusion from the first to the second act the genre in display changes from a fun lighthearted romance to a horror thriller featuring a haunted mansion the tone change is far from being smooth however the third act stores a drastic shift in pretty much everything tone genre story and even characters i cant get into details but its the most incomprehensible decision in the entire film the last act not only follows a path that comes from nowhere but its also incredibly rushed concluding the movie in the most disjointed convoluted way possible it raises questions related to events and characters in the previous act it treats mrs danvers very poorly and ends with a deceiving last shot that makes the viewer think did i miss something when the answer is a clear no its just a weird ending clint mansells score is captivating but its timing is just completely off its this feeling of false uncertainty that leaves me frustrated why try to make a film about something that its not why try to give rebecca a horror vibe if it doesnt lead to any impactful outcome i finished the movie with doubts that have no reason to exist simply because the question should have never been asked by the story in the first place all in all netflixs version of rebecca gets lost in trying to balance so many genres in just one film ben wheatley does a great job controlling the pacing offering enough time to develop the main characters and the core relationship however the tone changes are far from being wellexecuted leading to an utterly absurd rushed convoluted last act out of nowhere that raises logical questions and leaves the viewer with a false sense of uncertainty a wellstructured entertaining first half partially compensates for the weirdness that overflows the second part lily james and armie hammer deliver great performances as does kristin scott thomas but the production design supported by terrific costumes steals the spotlight clint mansells score doesnt go unnoticed but its placement is exceptionally inefficient in the end the attempt at creating a horror atmosphere with the haunted mansion storyline is so anticlimactic that i cant wholeheartedly recommend this flick ",

spotless mind are some of his most notable works but its synecdoche new york thats considered by many as one of the best films of the respective decade therefore i was obviously excited about his return to liveaction movies since 2008 hes only made the animated feature anomalisa  im thinking of ending things boasts an incredibly talented cast capable of seating me down and make me watch any film they participate in even though jessie buckley dolittle is sort of a new face to me my expectations were moderately high so how did it go im not going to lie i found this movie so intricate that i had a really hard time figuring it all out as soon as it ended i knew i didnt understand it in full which generated an unusual yet refreshing feeling inside me i felt the need to not only think about the film all night but since i didnt have the time to watch it again i returned to a few specific scenes in the next morning i also researched a bit and talked with a fellow critic to settle some of my minds internal debates i write this to imply that this is not an easy movie to decipher which will definitely throw some people off its a film that requires all of the viewers attention and selfquestioning capability otherwise things will get complicated as usual im not sharing any spoilers so ill keep my opinion about the storys multiple interpretations to the bare minimum of all the numerous ways of explaining this movie i found two either from jessie buckleys characters perspective or from jesse plemons i like both for different reasons in terms of logic which every viewer will struggle to find plemons character is the key to understand the remarkably complex multilayered narrative looking at the film from his perspective everything makes much more sense however its surprisingly from buckleys view that i find the movies message to be more interesting and likely to resonate with most people making an impactful move in life requires determination courage decisiveness moving to another country switching jobs ending a relationship all can be extremely demanding and psychologically painful im thinking of ending things brilliantly demonstrates how one can delay these actions sometimes indefinitely from the excruciatingly long car drives almost an hour of the runtime is spent inside the car listening to the main characters debating apparently random philosophical themes to the enigmatic transitions of time passing by kaufmans screenplay keeps transmitting a message of how people are stationary and time just keeps flowing this film takes ambiguousness and metaphoric filmmaking to a whole other level not only everything the viewer is seeing has in some shape or form a philosophical meaning but the dialogues between the main characters are themselves about cultural intellectual sophisticated matters some of these conversations have an eventual impact in the narrative or in the characters some just feel like kaufman needed to express his thoughts on several subjects with a runtime of slightly over two hours this movie overstays its welcome a bit due to the insistence in delivering repetitive similar scenes with the same goal the time shenanigans performed in the parents house is undoubtedly intriguing but its more distracting than helpful storywise having in mind the already puzzling narrative the confusion associated with understanding how time works only creates even more doubts it also deviates the viewers attention from the real focus which didnt help my first viewing in fact i was so concentrated trying to comprehend the purpose behind the oldyoung versions of the characters that i completely lost track of the runtime ultimately thinking the film was near its ending when it still had forty minutes to go theres a limit to how abstract and implicit a movie can be without becoming genuinely hard to understand and kaufman walks that threshold successful sometimes not that much in other moments nevertheless i can only share compliments from now on firstly the cast ive been in love with anything toni collette does since hereditary and once again shes weirdly captivating as an amusing yet disturbing mother david thewlis offers a subtler performance as well as jesse plemons even though the latter explodes with emotion in the third act however jessie buckley steals the spotlight in impeccable fashion like i mentioned in the beginning i know very little of her as an actress but ill make sure to add her to the list of actresses to follow closely with one of the biggest emotional ranges seen this year she delivers an incredibly captivating display one that should guarantee her name in future contenders list for the awards season from citing entire poems to fiercely debating any topic thrown at her by plemons her commitment to the role is palpable an astonishing performance that i will remember for a long time however its in the technical realm that this film achieves perfection without the shadow of a doubt this is the best movie of the year when it comes to the technical attributes until the date of this review obviously  almost every filmmaking element carries a tremendous impact in either the narrative or its characters the purposefully rough editing robert frazen adds to the perplexing atmosphere the lighting plus the production molly hughes and set design mattie siegal help identify where a particular event is happening the detailed costume design melissa toth and the impressive makeup are vital to the understanding of everything that occurs in the parents house the distinct cinematography ukasz al elevates every single action performed by the characters its a technically flawless film and i wouldnt be surprised to see it being nominated for several categories when the time comes im thinking of ending things might be a netflix original movie but it screams a24 all the way from the incredibly perplexing narrative told through bizarre storytelling to its distinctly unconventional technical characteristics charlie kaufman offers a remarkably complex film that can take different interpretations and may require more than one viewing  his insistence in transmitting one of the films messages through neverending philosophical conversations and confusing timebending distractions stretch the story to an unnecessary long runtime that hurts the overall piece nevertheless all messages are successfully delivered through an intriguing headscratching weirdly captivating story packed with cultural debates and unique characters an absolutely outstanding jessie buckley elevates every single line of dialogue showing tremendous emotional range but the impressively talented cast also improves the multilayered screenplay technically it is and it will remain as one of the best movies of the year every technical aspect is close to perfection and almost all have a massive impact on the story and how the viewer interprets it it will undoubtedly create a gap between critics and audiences since it has all the ingredients that usually place these groups at opposite extremes i can only recommend it to people who are able to dedicate

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog this is it the last david finchers film ill be able to review before mank his next masterpiece i hope ive been through se7en fight club zodiac the social network and now its time for finchers latest installment gone girl clearly fincher loves to work with people he knows jeff cronenweth has been his director of photography in half of his movies same for kirk baxter as part of the editing team and trent reznor and atticus ross in the musical score even his production designer donald graham burt has been around since zodiac however fincher always works with a different writer and this time he partners up with a debutant screenwriter gillian flynn author of the original novel that originates this adaptation usually when it comes to writers i take this change of media with a grain of salt since writing a book isnt exactly the same as writing a screenplay its completely different i was being generous  with that said flynn absolutely destroys my selfdoubts delivering one of the best scripts of 2014 from the exceptionally captivating perplexing disappearance of amy to the underlying theme about how press and media treat this type of news flynns screenplay is impressively able to develop each and every narrative in the most perfect way possible with a remarkable use of time date stamps the viewer follows in a detailed manner the events that build up to the tragic day through different perspectives mainly amys and nicks this storys greatest accomplishment is how it makes the press influence what the viewer thinks about the characters just like in real life nowadays people dont even click to read the full article and understand its context a single headline as far from the truth as it might be is enough to start a worldwide online debate the same goes for television networks and their news shows if its on the national news program then it must be true people think i may be wrong when i wrote the whole change of media matter before but of this im sure take every news article you read with a grain of salt because most of the time the full true story isnt entirely revealed this takes me to ben affleck justice league the way back and what i consider one of the best casting choices of the respective decade in case you dont know affleck has been pursued throughout his whole life by journalists who try their hardest to expose his personal life no matter how disrespectful it may turn out to be nick goes through the exact same obstacle theres nonstop news about amy and it only becomes a matter of time until nick starts being accused of being a terrible husband and ultimately the obvious killer even though the press cant find a single proof affleck doesnt even need to incorporate a new character since he has the necessary life experience to offer an utterly brilliant performance definitely one of my favorite actors working today since im in the realm of performances i might as well continue with rosamund pike radioactive  her interpretation of amy is almost the opposite of afflecks in the sense that the latter gives a seemingly simple yet powerful display while pike has a much more complex layered role she can be menacing and scary but also loving and kind the puzzle surrounding her disappearance is mostly based on a perspective enigma as the viewer is told the same story through different lenses throughout the first half of the film honestly this is probably a careerbest performance for pike who portrays a character of extremes allowing her to demonstrate her jawdropping emotional range carrie coon margo dunne is another actress ive grown to deeply enjoy watching and shes terrific as nicks sister her chemistry with affleck is spoton and i sincerely hope that one day she becomes one of the most coveted actresses in hollywood tyler perry tanner bolt is also pretty great as nicks lawyer but kim dickens is even greater as detective rhonda boney who partially plays the same role as the viewer by trusting that what she sees and hears is undoubtedly the ultimate truth flynns screenplay is packed with twists and turns some of them more surprising than others but the third act saves an unexpected shocking turn of events leading to a powerful ending that will leave most audiences speechless myself included two minor issues one of them you probably have already figured it out since i left neil patrick harris desi collings out of the cast compliments above harris is fine as the character he portrays but i cant help but feel that he wasnt the right actor for the role this is a classic fincher movie dark somber depressing tragic and with its own share of violence and blood in fact it possesses one of the most disgusting disturbing uses of blood in a single scene ive ever seen harris is an excellent actor but he stands out from the rest of the cast and not in a positive way again fine performance just not the right role for him the other problem is admittedly an irrelevant nitpick regarding a few details storywise that stretch the believability of everything just a bit nevertheless this is still a phenomenal film and its another evidence of david finchers masterful visual filmmaking once again fincher works with his known crew members to create a sumptuous look and feel with seamless editing a memorable score and fantastic camera work gone girl is technically magnificent but its gillian flynns debut screenplay that steals the spotlight boasting jawdropping twists including an utterly shocking third act and respective ending flynns narrative is incredibly engaging due to its remarkable structure and puzzling mystery never losing an inch of excitement or interest ben affleck is one of the best casting choices of the decade by interpreting a man whose life is deeply affected by the press and media which should never be fully trusted a clear and powerful message to the audience  while rosamund pike delivers her careerbest performance with an emotionally devastating display despite the misstep of casting neil patrick harris in such a dark movie and a couple of nitpicks regarding the investigation everything and everyone else turn this into one of the best films of the 2010s ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog  when it comes to the terminator franchise i share the same opinion as most people the 1984s original became a cult classic and its one of the most influential scifi action films of alltime terminator 2 judgment day is one of the very few sequels to such a beloved movie that actually improves on its predecessor standing as the number one film of the saga quality and entertainmentwise james cameron left the franchise and suddenly it all went down the sewer while terminator 3 rise of the machines is still tolerable salvation is absolutely terrible and the reboot genisys failed to change the sagas history compellingly so obviously even with the return of cameron to the production team my expectations were moderately low that said dark fate is the best terminator installment since t2 which is not saying much the last two flicks have great casts from christian bale to emilia clarke  but their scripts are baffling bad this time around the cast has amazing chemistry and their characters have better dialogue but it comes at a cost the last three movies possess stories that are not as captivating or entertaining or even rational as the first two films dark fate has a much better screenplay but again it comes at a cost what cost is this basically it repeats the exact same bits as the terminator an extremely thin line exists between paying homage to a movie and blatantly copying it tim millers team of screenwriters walk that line stumbling to both sides several times along the way some scenes are indeed wonderful nods to the sagas first two installments but a lot of other moments too many to be honest are pretty much a copypaste version of a significant plot point or character development arc from one of those films in case youre wondering this is the reason behind some of the hate from both critics and fans all over the world nowadays people are harsher with this sort of homages and the previously mentioned line is getting thinner and thinner another reason for the divisive opinions is the opening sequence dont worry i wont spoil they simply make a sudden and surprising narrative decision that takes some of t2s emotional impact at least without first clarifying why they made such a call therefore i gave the movie a chance to develop its idea but it doesnt it just goes with it and it never returns to this initial moment having this in mind i understand if people instantly decided to hate the film based on just that very first scene  because it really doesnt have any justification besides well we need a story dark fates screenplay is emotionally resonant and its also packed with mostly welldirected action sequences but it resembles the 1984s original plot too much theres even a direct line from sarah connor saying that a particular character is the equivalent of her son john this unnecessary and lazy exposition is surprisingly not as used as i expected it to be but when it occurs its like they chose the lamest silliest worse possible moments to place it however i cant deny i actually had fun with the movie with a much better script than the last films the cast was able to not only shine in a few scenes but their incredible chemistry allowed for outstanding moments seeing linda hamilton portray sarah connor once again is a delight to my eyes and arnold schwarzenegger is an awesome badass with hilarious lines these two are phenomenal nevertheless mackenzie davis steals the show as the enhanced soldier grace especially regarding the action scenes i dont think natalia reyes offered what her character needed since shes the protagonist after all but shes able to stand her ground i did enjoy gabriel luna take on the terminator rev9 but i wish he had a little bit of more screentime besides the action tim miller brings his talented directing chops from deadpool and applies his action techniques to deliver a lot of entertaining sequences the vfx team provides with some impeccable cgi but there are a couple of shots concerning a few speed bursts that should have received better treatment all in all terminator dark fate is the best terminator installment since judgment day but it still doesnt even reach the latters heels it boasts a fantastic cast with linda hamilton and arnold schwarzenegger returning to their respective iconic roles but mackenzie davis outshines both with some badass moments and great acting natalia reyes as the protagonist is disappointingly fine despite the action being welldirected and the screenplay being wellwritten it all comes at the cost of essentially replicating the 1984 originals plot some homages are notable but its so identical storywise that it takes away any sort of surprise severely lacking creativity in addition to this it makes a narrative decision in the opening sequence that removes some of t2s emotional impact damaging the sagas best movie and one of the greatest scifi action films of alltime i dont exactly recommend it but if youre a fan of the franchise go see it but with moderate expectations ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog ive always been a tremendous fan of animation if theres one comment i deeply despise is the animated films are for children this preconceived notion is extremely dated and honestly quite childish i dont even think it works within a teenage banter anymore since anime keeps growing exponentially around the world and animated movies are reaching more and more people as time goes by the whole you watch cartoons youre a baby bullying statement to make friends laugh about someone is now decadesold however i still feel a bit of pity for people who believe animation cant have the same emotional impact than liveaction especially when a major studio like pixar is known for making the most grownup of adults cry like an infant in addition to this some viewers think that the latter studio owned by disney is the only company making decent animated flicks when theyve been losing ground to other unbelievably talented people one of my favorite animated films of alltime is kubo and the two strings a stopmotion animation work from laika the studio that also created missing link and coraline cartoon saloon is emerging as an awardscontender studio by releasing movies such as song of the sea the breadwinner and now wolfwalkers the main difference between this last company and the others is the style of animation the old 2d animation that 90s kids like me grew up with thats precisely where im starting this review wolfwalkers 2d animation proves once again that this style will never become dated or less than the current 3d design dont be mistaken i love both styles im not part of the whole 2d vs 3d discourse simply because i firmly believe both have their own benefits and limitations 2d animation brings a sense of uniqueness and artistry to any story due to the distinct drawing from many skilled artists but its more limited than 3d when it comes to creating an immersive atmosphere and its respective world however the latter is becoming stagnated in its design structure since almost every 3d animated flick visually feels and looks the same so theres no good or bad right or wrong better or worse when it comes to animation i can offer dozens of examples of exceptional gorgeouslooking utterly superb animated flicks from both styles as well as awful corporatelike films that i try my hardest to forget looking at you the emoji movie  fortunately wolfwalkers belongs to the first group tomm moore and ross stewart direct an emotionally heartwarming tale with seamless execution of every single aspect will collins screenplay isnt particularly new or innovative though it follows a somewhat generic predictable story with key plot points that any viewer with minimum viewing experience will see coming from miles away however its a formula that if executed properly still delivers a rich passionate captivating narrative which will always please both children and adults just from the premise its pretty clear that the message of the movie is inspired by cliches such as dont judge people by their cover or our wants can steal someone elses needs and it even approaches racial discrimination since the film deals with two different populations obviously having in mind one of these societies is a pack of wolves theres also a message towards deforestation and excessive animal hunting leading thousands of species to their eventual extinction all of these themes are handled brilliantly and it never feels preachy it doesnt matter how unsurprising the story ends up being when i feel as absorbed by the characters and the animation as i did honor kneafsey and eva whittaker as robyn goodfellowe and mebh g mact re respectively display phenomenal voice work which is then elevated by the stunning expressive awardworthy animation sean bean is also terrific as bill goodfellowe robyns father who basically possesses the character arc that goes through the significant change of acknowledging understanding and accepting an entirely different culture and its people in this case animals  every character is incredibly wellwritten as are all dialogues surrounded by a celticinspired atmosphere myths and obviously music bruno coulais and folk group k la developed the movies original score and its undoubtedly one of my favorite soundtracks of 2020 including one of my favorite original songs running with the wolves in one of my favorite musical sequences of the year favorite is definitely the right oneword description of how i feel about wolfwalkers its one of those films i cant really point out a single flaw massive praise to the drawing artists who designed such a fantastic 2d world their work is often unappreciated and underrated besides being underpaid  so i want to offer cartoon saloon my biggest thank you and keep making excellent cinema i have no doubts wolfwalkers is by far and so far the best animated featurefilm ive seen all year i know the big gun from pixar is coming up soul  but it will have to be an absolutely perfect movie to surpass tomm moore and ross stewarts beautifully heartwarming celticinspired tale cartoon saloon continues to prove that 2d animation is still capable of delivering emotionally compelling stories through gorgeouslooking unique artistic drawings despite will collinss generic narrative and cliche messages every single detail is executed perfectly without a single flaw to point out outstanding voice work from honor kneafsey and eva whittaker as the wellwritten captivating protagonists however its bruno coulais and k las original score that melts my heart and sends chills down my spine every time i listen to it one of my favorite films of the year id be extremely surprised with myself if it doesnt end on my top10 watch it with your family its worth it ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog netflix has been able to deliver films with allstar casts pretty regularly whether people like the movie or not thats a whole other subject but as a convincing argument to make people want to watch a film this type of casting is perfect almost every actor in the devil all the time is a fanfavorite due to their presence in cinematic universes iconic sagas or oscarwinning flicks so its no surprise if this aspect alone gets audiences to sit in their couches for a movie with an almost twohourandahalf runtime this is my first time watching an antonio campos film and my expectations were moderately high having in mind the synopsis and the genre itself i didnt know what the movie was really about since the synopsis doesnt really shine a light on what the main narrative truly addresses i only watch the first official trailer after i watch the film so i know what i can write in my reviews  and to be honest its a bit misleading when it comes to the time certain actors are actually onscreen holland only shows up after fortyfive minutes for example  so for the first hourandahalf i found myself struggling to understand where the story was going there are more than a handful of relevant characters and storylines being this my main issue with the flick but ill get there ill start with the cast and their characters the former group is impeccable as expected tom holland is undoubtedly the biggest surprise by delivering a part of him that no one had seen so far arvins personality is shaped based on his traumatic tragic violent childhood transitioning from the friendly neighborhood spiderman to such a haunted character is not an easy task but holland finds a way of dealing with the emotionally overwhelming dark path that arvin walks however this is a long movie where every character has an important role to play even those who barely impact the story until the last few minutes bill skarsg rd plays hollands father seamlessly incorporating a man whose blind faith in religion sets not only a horrible chain of events but it also establishes the overall theme for the film riley keough and jason clarke play a weird couple with a disturbing modus operandi but the former is genuinely impressive shes becoming quite an interesting actress by picking unique roles in unconventional movies everyone else is great robert pattinson eliza scanlen sebastian stan you name it but holland skarsg rd and keough are my absolute standouts as well as their characters theyre definitely most developed across the runtime than the others which takes me to one of my negatives with so many characters the balance between the numerous storylines fails to be consistent enough to keep me engaged throughout the entire runtime antonio and paulo campos offer every character a good chunk of time giving the viewer opportunity to understand the motivations behind said characters and connect with their story excellent storytelling method no doubt about it however by the end of the film some characters have close to zero impact on the narrative in retrospect contrasting with my standouts a few characters feel onedimensional used merely either as a plot device to make the story go forward or as an object for gratuitous gory bloody killing that last aspect might be a nogo for tons of viewers there are dozens of sequences where a character is brutally shot or beat close to death so you have my warning it can go from entertaining to excessively gruesome in a matter of seconds nevertheless the thing i love the most about the devil all the time will be the exact same many viewers will definitely hate its take on religion similarly to darren aronofskys mother this is a movie that doesnt shy away from depicting how blind faith in hardcore religiousness can be dark somber sinful and take people through the most terrible of paths its the overall theme that connects every storyline throughout the film almost every characters decision is made based on their religious beliefs in some shape or form if they believe praying is the solution to cancer theyll pray for days in a row and make sacrifices if they believe god is giving them supernatural powers theyll do everything to test his will if they believe god is telling them to make the most illogical decisions perform inhuman actions and sin in the most awful way possible theyll do it in the blink of an eye this religious manipulation is depicted in such a realistic manner that it transforms the devil all the time into a pretty tricky viewing for me it felt so authentic that i can easily connect it to the state of the real world from the moment i realized this underlying theme the second half of the movie became much more interesting character arcs start to intertwine previous questions being to receive their respective answers and everything falls into place in the last thirty to fortyfive minutes however the runtime still feels way too long and even though antonio and paulo campos do a remarkable job by coherently joining the several storylines some of these simply dont add anything to the narrative or to the protagonists arc technically impressive across the board standouts being lol crawleys lingering cinematography and the sweet score from danny bensi and saunder jurriaans the devil all the time is destined to be incredibly divisive antonio campos and paulo campos conjured up a somber dark extremely violent screenplay packed with numerous storylines and an underlying theme thats going to cause some controversy with such a stellar cast its impossible not to have outstanding performances the entire cast is impeccable but tom holland the absolute standout  riley keough and bill skarsg rd deserve the shoutout due to their genuinely impressive displays however the high number of characters and their respective arcs unnecessarily overextend the runtime too much time is given to characters who in retrospect barely have an impact in the narrative or in the protagonist some are used as mere plot devices or kill targets for the sake of entertainment nevertheless the narratives focus on religion is bold and audacious showing how blind faith can negatively influence peoples lives taking them and others through the most painful paths depending on each persons view on religion on how open the mind can be and the sensibility to bloody violence i leave my warning that this film might not be for everyone but if it is for you it will be hard to forget  ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog after a pleasant revisit to godzilla 2014  now comes the time for kong skull island the second installment in warner bros and legendarys shared cinematic universe i watched this film at its original release date and never saw it again not because i deeply disliked it or anything of that level but i never felt a strong desire to rewatch it i remember feeling indifferent towards the movie since it didnt really surprise me in any aspect if theres one thing no one can complain about monsterverse its the jawdropping visuals that would evolve beyond the wildest expectations as years went by but even these didnt blow me away completely in this film nevertheless a small part of me had high hopes for this rewatch the screenplays of these first two movies are pretty similar concerning their narrative structure naturally most of the runtime is spent with human characters who in this case wander around an uncharted land supposedly to perform geologic studies this time more monsters are displayed onscreen besides kong and his main adversary leading to more action sequences most in broad daylight which is a major plus basically any viewer is able to follow every fight even the ones that happen at night since theyre beautifully shot by larry fong dp  who uses fire as a lighting device to produce some wallpaperworthy images kong looks incredible and the monster fights are utterly riveting the monsters visuals hold up strong for most of the runtime except when humans get involved despite a fantastic scene between kong and samuel l jacksons character some of the humans vs monsters sequences are way too weird several feature too noticeable green screen mixing humans and monsters in close proximity which didnt work as seamlessly as intended still viewers who complained about the lack of godzilla in his own flick will be more satisfied not only with the increase of action sequences but also with the main monsters sightings kong is a visible powerful presence throughout the film and jordan vogtroberts used him right when the movie needed the big monkey the most however the characters are so hollow cliche insignificant and underdeveloped that the time spent with them is much heavier than in the previous film which is by far the biggest problem with this movie its true that godzilla doesnt deliver a perfect balance between humans and monsters but at least the former group feels like such from clear motivations to welldefined personalities the protagonists are quite compelling and captivating making the third act reach greater levels of excitement and overall impact the short period of monsters fighting each other is so efficient and feels so good that viewers left the theaters demanding more but this feeling only arose due to the time spent with the human characters that offered bigger stakes to the last act vogtroberts film features a great cast no doubt about it but only john c reillys character gets a decent arc therefore despite spending more time with humans and seeing fewer monsters in godzilla kong skull island feels slower and lazier so many unnecessary exposition dumps  ultimately transforming the higher amount of action less impactful in addition to this a couple of likable characters meet their end in an extremely underwhelming embarrassingly illogical manner which always leaves me a bit annoyed i wish the screenwriters delved more into kongs story through other methods besides generic exposition but at least they keep the balance of nature overarching narrative from the cinematic universe technically i already applauded the visuals above but ill do it again kong truly is a beauty of a monster any wide shots of him standing up are outstanding but the one with the sunset in the background is a gorgeous painting on the screen henry jackmans score is definitely exciting possessing a memorable kongs theme music tom hiddleston thor films avengers infinity war and brie larson captain marvel avengers endgame make a good duo but john c reilly the lobster tale of tales steals the spotlight the editing richard pearson could be a lot better but overall its a wellproduced blockbuster as expected kong skull island doesnt reach the level of the previous monsterverses installment but its far from being a massive disappointment jordan vogtroberts sophomore movie follows a similar narrative structure to godzilla just with more action sequences visible and in daylight  more monsters and a visually stunning kong however most of the runtime stills belong to the humans who unfortunately are nowhere near to being as compelling as in the previous film except for john c reillys character everyone else is incredibly hollow annoyingly cliche and significantly underdeveloped making the time spent with them quite heavy the excessive reliance on lazy exposition scenes also drags the movie ultimately turning the monster battles less satisfying some narrative decisions concerning certain characters are questionable to say the least but overall i believe it still offers what viewers are looking for huge praise to larry fongs beautiful cinematography and henry jackmans addictive score  ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog  living in portugal has a ton of pros but regarding movies it lacks serious advantages the price of admission is expensive there is only one film theater in my city every time i want to watch a movie on imax or dolby atmos its a financial effort and timeconsuming and the worst of all a whole bunch of films arent released in their original date especially november december oscarbait movies only now i had the opportunity to see green book and i am so mad i wasnt able to write its review in 2018 because this is undoubtedly the best comedydrama of last year and one of the best overall with the help of a terrific cast peter farrelly and his writing crew which counts with vallelongas son nick deliver what i think is the best screenplay of 2018 i cant remember the last time i cried of so much laughter in a film i cant remember the last time i did the latter and still got emotional with the dramatic arc this comedydrama sent me through a roller coaster of emotions i wasnt expecting at all i went in anticipating outstanding performances check and solely that since 2019 has already begun im watching the oscarbait movies with no real hopes of being utterly amazed however green book completely took me by surprise i genuinely dont know why everyone was so shocked when it won best screenplay at the golden globe awards it possesses such a wellwritten story filled with brilliant narratives about the most sensitive subjects it takes the two main characters and elevates their individual arcs into subplots where you begin and end with two completely different personas its an extremely relevant film that shows how our world evolved and fought back racism and discrimination without ever becoming too dark or even dull its not more of the same its not another movie produced exclusively to send a social message and catch some oscar nominations its a truly captivating story of how two men can change their perspective of another race or even the entire world by actually spending time with another culture and ignoring preconceived notions nevertheless this wellstructured beautifullydirected and cleverlywritten film would be just good if not for the two incredible actors who take this movie to a whole other level viggo mortensen and mahershala ali have such compelling chemistry that i wouldnt mind watching them interact for two hours on a car trip every single car sequence either produces hilarious moments filled with tearful laughter or it drastically changes into a more dramatic and emotional tone subtly touching delicate topics i knew mortensen had a humorous side to him but i never saw this coming his timing his expressions his italian accent his body movements everything about his performance is perfect he absolutely nailed his part by giving me the best time i had at a film theater in a long time and his oscar nomination is more than fair he made a 130min feature movie feel like a short flick ali doesnt come far behind obviously since viggo has a funnier role to portray the audience members might feel that hes just there to help his costar shine but he does much more than that since he brings the drama element to the story he has a more restrained performance during the first half of the film however once shirley starts getting along with tony lip ali gradually offers more and more splendid acting moments hes definitely a supporting actor but god is he a phenomenal one linda cardellini dolores vallelonga  even though shes only onscreen for a few minutes spread throughout the runtime also delivers a great performance tony lip and dr don shirley have quite distinct personalities besides being from different races each characters arc is brilliantly illustrated by peter farrelly who gradually shows how tony and don are changing their view of the world and of each others culture either through the witty car sequences or through unfortunate and horrible experiences these two characters carry the audience on a journey of growth change in behavior mindset and preconceived ideas by sharing their own culture with another even though they were born in different countries and lived through distinguished lifestyles with contrasting quality of life they eventually start realizing that what they think of the world and everything else might not be entirely right technically farrelly controls the movies pacing exceptionally well by making a twohourish film feel like half of it remarkablybalanced tone and some great cinematography is showed in a couple of scenes consistentlyfilmed and welledited even though the latter has small hiccups here and there nevertheless this isnt a film with extraordinary technical attributes nor it needs them farrelly only needed to do ok with the producing and filming of a standout screenplay to achieve a fantastic result and thats exactly what he did finally regarding the controversy surrounding this movie  see how easy it is to watch a film without being affected by outside matters which dont have a single thing to do with the movie itself i dont care if someone who worked in the film tweeted something wrong today let alone years ago i dont care if someone misinterprets viggo mortensens speech about racism i dont care if the family of don shirley doesnt like how the movie approaches his way of being or his way of life i dont care if the story isnt 100 true as long as it succeeds in transmitting the vital message it wants to deliver while actually being a good film so please stop trying to listen to everything everyone says about a movie or the people working on it especially nowadays where chaos is easy to create green book surprised the hell out of me and left me speechless in the end one of the best comedydramas ive seen in a long time one of the best films of 2017 and by far the best original screenplay of the last year peter farrelly and his fellow cowriters delivered a seamlesslywritten story filled with wonderful character arcs and with a quite important message to the audiences around the world viggo mortensen and mahershala ali deliver awardworthy performances especially the former who shows his incredible comedic timing and dramatic range still the most compelling and emotional scenes come from ali and he does not deserve to be forgotten i thought 2018 was going to be the first year without me giving an a  but guess what   ",

therefore its hype grew more and more until its wide release date before the film i cant deny that i was indeed affected by the whole a whodunnit like you havent seen in years i went into the theater with high expectations not only due to the festival praise but due to its jawdropping cast its uncommon to possess such a renowned ensemble and deliver a bad movie especially when rian johnson is writing and directing it yes i like the last jedi and even if i didnt he did other stuff you know  its one of those films everyone knows its going to be appreciated by a considerable part of the world even the genre itself is a very welcome type of cinema entertainment in regards to both critics and the general public so does it live up to its hype or it fails to reach such high expectations knives out is one of the best movies of the year as well as one of the best mysterysuspense stories of the millennium everyone is doing the whole best x of the decade im going one step beyond  this is a film i know im going to rewatch countless times throughout the next years usually when it comes to whodunnits people are misled into thinking that from the moment they know who did it the movie loses its interest this is rarely true and rian johnson succeeds because he doesnt need the ultimate reveal to deliver a great story this screenplay is definitely getting tons of nominations and wins during the awards season every little line of dialogue means something every single character says or does something impactful to the narrative except for jaeden martells  its been halfaday since ive seen it and for every question that my brain comes up with theres an answer lying on someones words or actions its such an intricate complex extremely subtle script one with so many tiny little details that its impossible to catch them all on a first viewing i genuinely love the first act even if its the one where i have a minor issue rian johnson doesnt waste time and puts us directly in the crime scene interviewing each and every member of the family its through these interrogatories that he cleverly introduces the suspects developing them solely through masterfully written dialogue and outstanding performances for example with a single sentence and a particular body face expression toni collette instantly creates a profile of joni her character rian plays with charactertypes and cliches in such an intelligent manner he makes us think a particular character follows a specific cliche then it doesnt then it does again thats one of the reasons i couldnt figure out the mystery until the last act reveal every time i was close to indeed follow the right path new developments arise meant to mislead confuse and create doubts some people feel better with themselves if they solve the case before the film they feel intellectually superior just because they found out before everyone else first of all i prefer being fooled and end up blown away by an unexpected conclusion than solving the whole thing way before times up and end up disappointed and bored then honestly anyone who says i guessed it theres a 99 chance that theyre either lying or not answering correctly to the question who killed harlan if youve seen the movie youll understand what im trying to express i dont want to sound presumptuous or hypocritical im not trying to say i couldnt figure it out so no one can please if you havent seen the film judge the previous paragraph after your viewing throughout the second and third acts loose ends start to tie up ending up with a brilliantly delivered reveal from the marvelous cinematography with those classic closeups when a character is about to say something meaningful or tell a story through their imagination or memory to the remarkable editing the team behind rian johnson did a phenomenal job the suspense is held at high levels and it reaches limitbreaking points with marta cabreras ana de armas narrative armas and daniel craig deliver the standout performances with chris evans ransom following right behind literally everyone else offers excellent displays and help carry a story filled with mystery but also with a lot of humor however i have to emphasize how astonishing ana de armas and daniel craig are ana might be a bit unknown to most people ive been supporting her ever since blade runner 2049 so im ecstatic that she finally got a major role in a big movie especially within an ensemble of actors with legendary careers craig who could have just delivered a slight variation of the character hes been playing for years instead offers a unique take on the detective role just like evans both have been playing iconic characters for years so its sort of an extra joke to everyone who watched captain america and james bond for the past decade or so my only minor issue has nothing to do with the political undertone and the social messages rian johnson puts in this film honestly i love that aspect of it its like rian knew some people would complain about it so he made sure to have a couple of characters jaeden martells jacob and katherine langfords meg somewhat resembling the socalled snowflakes and all that no my issue is related to some excessive exposition regarding the first acts interrogatories its great that every character gets their own motivations but it feels like each confrontation with the detectives went on for a bit too long some pieces of the mystery might be a bit hard to believe that they would occur but these are all nitpicks in a remarkable movie in the end rian johnson is able to bounce back from the divisive the last jedi with one of the best whodunnits ive ever seen knives out rian proves that not only hes a talented filmmaker but also a phenomenal screenwriter with a renowned and impressive ensemble cast daniel craig and ana de armas are standouts within all of the other outstanding performances chris evans being right behind with one of the best screenplays of the year the mystery at its center keeps everyone extremely captivated until the very end even if you guess who did it beforehand masterfully written dialogue remarkable editing and great use of classic cinematography techniques its an entertaining story with tremendous replay value and significant political social layers that only elevate the already complex yet subtle narrative dont miss it ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog i was never the biggest fan of scoobydoos animated cartoon when i was young i enjoyed it like any other kid who enjoys almost everything but it was never a show that made me nervously excited during the day waiting for it to come on tv i vividly remember getting pumped knowing that a new episode of dragon ball z or timon pumba would broadcast on that particular day i never felt that way with scoobydoo and honestly i dont know why i was always curious about scifi and what lies beyond so maybe the fact that the goal of the show was to justify every single paranormal activity with some guy in a mask didnt really appeal to the kid in me either way i still liked the series and my memory is filled with all of the shows classic signatures the double or even triple unmasking of the villains scooby jumping to shaggys arms because they both got scared the ridiculously large sandwiches you name it ironically the biggest compliment i can give the film also relates to its major flaw for any fan of the show these classic moments will provide high levels of nostalgia and entertainment so anyone who comes looking for that will definitely get what they desire however even though scoob is far from feeling like a corporate flick packed with product placement looking at you sonic the hedgehog  i cant help but feel that the studio was embarrassed by its own property they try so hard to make this movie belong to 2020 that they completely forgot about what makes the show special for so many people from the weirdly confusing song selection to the way too modern plot points scoob s narrative distinctly follows an avengersstyle plot including an obvious allusion to captain america holding his shield focusing strongly on the superhero theme they didnt believe that mystery inc and the successful formulaic story were enough to hold the target audiences attention so they decided to borrow from one of the most entertaining and financially impactful genres of today losing the essence of their own ip therefore despite scoob having almost all of the cartoons classic scenes it still feels detached from the source material in addition to this if youre not a fan of scoobydoo and if you dont know anything about it then dont expect this film to explain anything to you fred velma and daphne get separated from shaggy and scooby early on due to a hilariously dumb scene that only kids will accept  so almost no character development occurs within the first group of people this movie focuses more on the pairs adventure and their relationship dynamics which are explored in a cliche yet efficient manner  leaving 3 5 of the mystery inc feeling left off actually now that i think about it scoob doesnt even have a mystery to solve in the cartoons every episode is about discovering what or whos causing a specific paranormal event this film basically follows that formula for the first fifteen minutes which serve as an origin story of the gang and then takes an entirely different path storywise im not going to complain about the plots absurdity because its undeniably a kids movie but these forced attempts to adapt scoobydoo to 2020 are what ruin the whole thing for me the voice acting is great though and hearing frank welker interpret scooby again is incredibly joyful all in all scoob possesses almost all of the classic moments from the original cartoon which will surely leave fans of the series satisfied and feeling that heartwarming nostalgia in addition to this the voice work is really good for the most part especially from the legend frank welker as scooby however the studio hurts the film with countless attempts to adapt the formulaic yet successful screenplay that the show employed for decades into 2020 from the superherolike plot to the lack of a central mystery tony cervone finds himself in a writing mess four screenwriters and three story by credits from a company ashamed of its own product if youre a hardcore fan of the animated show this movie might leave you satisfied but if you dont share a special connection with these characters and their classic adventures or if you dont know anything about this franchise at all scoob not only doesnt care to introduce or develop its characters but it definitely isnt going to convert you ",

    "text": "if you enjoy reading my spoilerfree reviews please follow my blog i dont know why now but i didnt watch mass as a premiere during sundance instead i left it to an ondemand viewing for the next day as soon as i finished wild indian which i sort of liked  i knew i made a mistake mass is one of the heaviest unbreathable overwhelmingly emotional films ive ever seen this review was supposed to have been up 24h ago but i needed to process everything and sleep on it its even more shocking considering this is a feature directorial debut for fran kranz who becomes a filmmaker worthy of all my attention from now on his impressive direction takes the viewers through a story told in such a raw authentic way that even a simple room with chairs and a table is enough to hold the audience at the edge of their seats for the entire runtime technically i must praise kranzs miseensc ne which tells a story on its own through the movement of the actors and the position of certain set elements during each scene from something seemingly irrelevant as the carefully placed flowers and tissues to the extremely tense atmosphere created by the parents uncomfortable disposition i finished the movie emotionally exhausted as if someone had drained everything inside me this takes me to one of the most compelling devastating heartfelt performances ive ever seen in a single film every actor incorporates their respective characters in such a giving passionate manner that im sure this movie was as hard to shoot for them as it was for the viewers to watch jason isaacs ann dowd martha plimpton and reed birney all deserve nominations in every awards show worldwide i cant even pick a standout interpretation because all are genuinely magnificent theyre all so extraordinarily invested in dealing with their characters struggles that i couldnt stop tearing up after each line of dialogue everyone has at least one big moment to shine and everyone nails that moment in a jawdropping way however mass is far from being an actor showcase it brings several sensitive important matters to the table literally  such as gun violence and the impact of video games on young people but it also addresses feelings that are tough to deal with forgiveness love the ability to move on grief loss anger guilt depression and so much more its one of those films that will undoubtedly impact every single viewer even if its in a negative way as much as i love everything i saw on the screen its also a movie i dont see myself watching again at least not more than two times it ends in an expectedly positive light but it might be too emotionally demanding for me in this current phase of my life mass is undoubtedly one of the most emotionally challenging viewings ive ever had to face fran kranzs feature directorial debut tells an unbelievably heavy story through four actors who dive deep into their characters all delivering careerbest performances everyone is an incredible standout jason isaacs ann dowd martha plimpton and reed birney deserve a massive campaign to receive every acting award there is the cast drains every single ounce of emotion within the viewers transforming a tiny little room with impactful miseensc ne that tells its own story into an extremely tense heartwrenching almost unbreathable environment dozens of meaningful matters and challenging feelings are addressed in the span of little less than two hours creating a truly devastating film that left me sobbing its utterly impossible for someone not to be affected by this movie even if its in a negative way its one of those films that ill recommend to everyone and support throughout its eventual release but i cant deny this might have been my one and only watch of such a brutally demanding authentic story ",
